===Remarks===

'''Note:'''  In addition to the attributes, properties, events, methods, and styles listed above, SVG elements also inherent core HTML attributes, properties, events, methods, and styles.

The closepath command ('''Z''' or '''z''') ends the current subpath and causes an automatic straight line to be drawn from the current point to the initial point of the current subpath. If you follow a "closepath" command immediately by a "moveto" command, the "moveto" command identifies the start point of the next subpath. If you follow a "closepath" command  immediately by any other command,  the next subpath starts at the same initial point as the current subpath.

When a subpath ends in a "closepath" command, the implementation of 'stroke-linejoin' and 'stroke-linecap'  differs from when you manually close a subpath through a "lineto" command. With a "closepath" command, the end of the final segment of the subpath is joined with the start of the initial segment of the subpath by using the current value of 'stroke-linejoin'. If you manually close the subpath through a "lineto" command, the start of the first segment and the end of the last segment are each capped by using the current value of 'stroke-linecap' instead of being joined. At the end of the command, the new current point is set to the initial point of the current subpath.
