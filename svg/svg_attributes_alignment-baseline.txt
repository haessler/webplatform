===Remarks===

This property specifies how an object is aligned with respect to its
parent.  For example, this allows alphabetic baselines in Roman text
to stay aligned across font size changes.  It defaults to the baseline
with the same name as the computed value of the alignment-baseline
property.  That is, the position of "ideographic" alignment-point in
the block-progression-direction is the position of the "ideographic"
baseline in the baseline-table of the object being aligned.

One of the characteristics of international text is that there are
different baselines (different alignment points) for glyphs in
different scripts.  For example, in horizontal writing, ideographic
scripts, such as Han Ideographs, Katakana, Hiragana, and Hangul,
alignment occurs with a baseline near the bottoms of the glyphs;
alphabetic based scripts, such as Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic,
align a point that is the bottom of most glyphs, but some glyphs
descend below the baseline; and Indic based scripts are aligned at a
point that is near the top of the glyphs.

The "EM box" is a relative measure of the height of the glyphs in the
font.  The "M" character fits in a box 1 EM high and 1 EM wide.
