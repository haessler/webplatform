{{Summary_Section|This is a time in seconds which starts at zero when the context is created and increases in real-time. All scheduled times are relative to it. This is not a ''transport'' time which can be started, paused, and re-positioned. It is always moving forward. A GarageBand-like timeline transport system can be very easily built on top of this (in JavaScript). This time corresponds to an ever-increasing hardware timestamp.}}
