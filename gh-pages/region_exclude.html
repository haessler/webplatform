<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Foreign policy discussions tend to focus on government policies and
diplomatic initiatives.  But relations between India and the United
States have been driven substantially by corporations and individuals,
with the two nations' governments trailing behind and catching up only
now. During the Cold War, India's quasimilitary relationship with the
Soviet Union led to cool Indo-U.S. governmental relations. Despite
this, Indian citizens went in droves to the United States for
education and employment, and the United States became India's largest
trade partner. After India's economic reforms in 1991, two-way flows
of individuals and corporate activity greatly accelerated.  U.S.
corporations became an important foreign policy lobby for India in the
U.S. Congress. The Indian diaspora in the United States grew rapidly
to 3 million, and these people are among the richest, best-educated
ethnic groups in the United States, and hence politically influential,
too.

<p>The Indian and U.S. governments, far apart during the Cold War,
have now started building on the solid foundation created by
individuals and corporations. The George W. Bush-Manmohan Singh
nuclear deal of 2005 was a landmark event. Later, President Obama
backed India for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security
Council.

<p>Individuals and corporations have also taken the lead in expanding
India's footprint in other countries across the globe. The India-based
Tata group is now the largest private-sector employer in the United
Kingdom. As in the Indo-U.S.  case, Sino-Indian commercial and
individual relationships have also grown despite cool governmental
relations, and could one day lead to warmer political relations.

<p>The lesson is that good economic policy is good foreign policy,
too. Indian foreign policy should promote measures that expand
individual and corporate ties with the United States, as well as other
countries. This means embracing globalization and emphasizing
international exchanges in trade, investment, and the movement of
people. India must see the movement of talented Indians abroad as
mutually enriching "brain circulation," not a "brain drain." Even
those Indians who do not return to India become a foreign policy asset
in the shape of a powerful diaspora. Indian diplomacy needs to pay
more attention to harnessing this asset.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As India grows in wealth and global influence, U.S. foreign policy
experts find themselves facing difficult questions: Are Indo-U.S.
relations improving or worsening? Is the U.S. support of India for a
United Nations Security Council seat meaningless in practice? Did
India's decision not to support a U.S.-advocated no-fly zone over
Libya in March 2011 imply that it is drifting away from the United
States? Can India improve its relations with China, even while
improving them with the United States?

<p>Many foreign policy analyses focus on these and other
intergovernmental issues.  This paper aims to show that the Indo-U.S.
relationship has actually been driven substantially by exchanges
between individuals and corporations--not just diplomats or
politicians--for six decades. The nations' two governments have, by and
large, simply been catching up in the last two decades.  Something
similar has happened in other countries, too, with corporations and
individuals developing bilateral relations and governments catching up
later. India needs to follow policies that help globalize flows of
trade, investment, and labor. That will expand the scope for
corporations and individuals to create strong ties, and for
governments to catch up.

<p>Such governmental catch-up has produced some impressive results,
such as the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal of 2005. As long as business and
individual ties keep strengthening, there is little need to get either
euphoric or depressed about the ups and downs of Indo-U.S. foreign or
defense relations. Even when intergovernment relations run into rough
weather--something that will happen from time to time--they will be
calmed, although not completely, by the strength and resilience of
business and individual relations.

<p>The same phenomenon can be seen in Indian relations with other
countries around the globe. The scope for corporate and individual
exchanges was limited during India's socialist era, when the country's
leaders emphasized self-sufficiency and discouraged global
interdependence. But with the end of the Cold War and start of Indian
economic reforms in 1991, Indian corporate and individual ties have
expanded rapidly across the globe. This has provided a good foundation
for governments to build on later. An interesting example is
China. After their border war of 1962, political relations between
India and China were cool. But in the last decade, Sino-Indian
commercial and individual relations have boomed. This has some
potential for creating warmer political relations, although the
conditions are nowhere near as favorable as in the Indo-U.S. case.

<h2>The Blooming of Indo-U.S. Relations</h2>

<p>India's global image and clout have been transformed in the last
two decades. For decades after becoming independent in 1947, it was
seen as a bottomless pit for foreign aid, holding world records in
starvation and poverty. India tried to project itself as a Third World
leader, and its talented diplomats were at the very forefront of
debates on ending colonialism, promoting non-alignment, and expanding
a new field called development economics. India was prominent in
establishing and expanding the Non-Aligned Movement, and played a
leading role in the G-77 group of developing countries in economic
discussions in the World Bank, the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and other
international forums.

<p>However, its emphasis in the 1950s on Third World and Sino-Indian
solidarity in opposing colonialism took a knock when it was thrashed
by China in a short war in 1962 and barely held its own in another
short war with Pakistan in 1965. The Non-Aligned Movement was in one
sense a success; almost all developing countries joined it. Yet in
another sense non-alignment became meaningless when the movement
admitted countries spanning the entire ideological range from
Singapore to Cuba. The search for sheer numbers made the Non-Aligned
Movement intellectually vacuous.<a class="endnoteref" id="a1" href="#e1">1</a>

Economic reforms since 1991 have spurred GDP growth averaging 8
percent in the last decade.
</aside>

<p>By following inward-looking socialist policies for three decades,
India condemned itself to GDP growth of just 3.5 percent per year,
half the rate of many miracle economies in East Asia. Other developing
countries came to view India as pretty good for drafting resolutions
at international conferences, but pretty useless as a role model for
economic or political development. Neither Indian democracy nor
socialism looked very appealing to other developing countries.

<p>However, there has been a dramatic change in the last decade. The
cumulative impact of economic reforms since 1991 have spurred GDP
growth averaging 8 percent in the last decade, leading analysts to
project India as a potential economic superpower--the only possible
Asian counterweight to China in the 21st century, and a top candidate
for permanent membership of the UN Security Council. Forget its old
attempts to lead the G-77; India is now a member of the G-20, the
group of the 20 most powerful nations in the world. The New Statesman
had a cover story on India in its issue of July 14, 2011, and the
blurb on the cover said, "By 2030 it will be bigger than China. Should
we fear this new superpower?"<a class="endnoteref" id="a2" href="#e2">2</a>

<p>India's first entry point into the "big league" came in 2005, when
U.S. president George W. Bush and Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh
reached an agreement exempting India from sanctions over its refusal
to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This exemption was seen
by both leaders as the start of a new strategic partnership.  At the
time, the Iraq war was going badly for Bush, and his political capital
in Washington was eroding rapidly. Yet, in the face of strong
opposition, he pushed through U.S.  legislation giving India a waiver
from nuclear sanctions, and then ensured approval of the Nuclear
Suppliers' Group (countries authorized by the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty to supply nuclear materials and
know-how). Future historians may conclude that the most successful
achievement of the Bush presidency was the creation of a new
U.S. partnership with India.

<p>In 2009, India's arrival as a major economic power was formalized
by making it a member of the G-20 group of nations.  President Obama
built further on this foundation during his visit to India in 2010 by
offering U.S. backing for India to become a permanent member of the UN
Security Council. This was a major initiative. However, it may not
bear fruit for a long time.  One Indian columnist compared it with
giving a ticket for the first commercial trip to Mars: a favor, no
doubt, but one long off in the future.<a class="endnoteref" id="a3" href="#e3">3</a>

</aside>
Still, the fact is that many Third World countries have sought
U.S. backing for a UN Security Council seat, but only India has
received it.

<p>This dizzy rise in bilateral relations looks especially dramatic
when one recalls that in 1998 the United States and other western
countries imposed economic sanctions on India after it conducted
nuclear weapons tests (followed closely by Pakistan). What happened in
the years after 1998 that so transformed relations? Four things stand
out.

<p>First, India emerged as a world-class software producer by becoming
a major contributor of software to tackle the "Y2K" problem (the
threat that computers with systems software designed for the 20th
century would suddenly crash when 2000 arrived).<a class="endnoteref" id="a4" href="#e4">4</a>

India built on this foundation, and later added other business
outsourcing services and research and development, to become an
important global force in services exports. In earlier decades, India
was seen as too focused on self-reliance, too uncompetitive in
exports, and hence not capable of playing a global role. However, by
the early 21st century, the majority of Fortune 500 companies decided
they had to have operations in India, for business services and
research and development, as well as for exploiting the fast-growing
Indian market.<a class="endnoteref" id="a5" href="#e5">5</a>

Indians who saw foreign investment as the return of the East
India Company were proved wrong.
</aside>

<p>India's emergence as a high-tech exporter of manufactures (notably
in pharmaceuticals and automobiles) proved its new competitiveness in
brainpower. This held far more longterm promise than the cheap-labor
exports specialized in by other Asian countries. This gave India a
special cachet. Besides, India had a large, fast-growing market that
U.S. corporations wished to take advantage of. These corporations
became unanticipated lobbyists for India in the U.S. Congress, and
helped change political attitudes there (see Box 1).

<blockquote class="wide">

<h2>Box 1. East India Company in Reverse</h2>

<p>Indians have historically feared foreign corporations as stalking
horses for imperial conquest. Great Britain's East India Company
started as a trading entity, but opened the path to British imperial
rule of India. So, when the Indian government started wooing foreign
investors with the launch of economic reforms in 1991, critics warned
that this would lead to the return of the East India Company--and
Western domination--in new forms. Business is never divorced from
politics, they said, and letting in American investors would
eventually mean U.S. domination of India's foreign policy, too.

<p>In fact, the very opposite has happened. By attracting American
investors, India unexpectedly obtained powerful foreign policy allies
in the form of U.S. corporations. The first proof of this came in
1998, when lobbying by corporate America gave India a triumph on human
rights in the U.S. Congress.

<p>In the 1990s, Rep. Dan Burton (R-IN) received strong backing and
contributions from Pakistanis and separatists Sikhs in the United
States. This support stemmed from Burton's filing an amendment to each
year's U.S. foreign-aid bill, demanding a cut of 25 percent in aid to
India as punishment for its alleged human-rights violations in Kashmir
and Punjab. Indian abuses in those states--where it was battling
insurgents, some backed by Pakistan--were worrisome, but they were no
worse than abuses by many U.S. allies, including Pakistan itself. As
an old U.S. military ally, Pakistan had far more friends in the
U.S. Congress than India. The proposed Burton amendment aimed to cut
the U.S. aid allotment to India by $56 million, a modest sum that
India could easily do without. But it was politically important for
India to scotch the Burton amendment.

<p>In 1995, a time when U.S. foreign investment in India had not quite
taken off, the Burton amendment failed by just 19 votes. This spelled
danger. But in 1996 his amendment was defeated by 169 votes. Next, in
1997, it was defeated by a whopping 260 votes.  The main reason for
this transformation was organized lobbying on India's behalf by
U.S. corporations that had invested in India.

<p>In the old socialist era, when India strove for self-sufficiency
and kept out foreign investors, India had no effective way of
influencing votes in the U.S. Congress. It could not compete with
Pakistan at a time when India was viewed as a Soviet ally. But in the
1990s an India Interest Group was formed in the United States. This
included as members General Motors, Boeing, Enron, Ford, AT&T,
Raytheon, Citicorp, Motorola, and Hughes. Business pressures helped
create an India Caucus in the U.S. Congress.

<p>Once India started attracting foreign investment, Pakistan lost
influence rapidly in Washington. Pakistan simply could not match
India's potential for trade and investment, so economic reform in
India gave birth to a foreign policy windfall. Until the 1990s,
U.S. diplomats tended to bracket India and Pakistan together in policy
discussions: India could not be given anything that Pakistan was not
given. But that changed once business and individuals forged a broad
Indo-U.S. relationship. Both India and 5 Pakistan were penalized with
sanctions for their nuclear tests in 1998. But subsequently, the
Indo-U.S. relationship became so strong at the corporate and
individual level that the notion of parity was broken
decisively. India got a nuclear deal in 2005 while Pakistan was denied
one. India also got U.S. backing for UN Security Council Membership
and G-20 membership--something Pakistan could not hope for.

<p>Indians who saw foreign investment as the return of the East India
Company were proved wrong. They were indeed right in thinking that
business and politics were interconnected, but they failed to see that
U.S. investment would increase Indian influence in the United States,
rather than make India subservient. The actual outcome was the East
India Company phenomenon in reverse.<a class="endnoteref" id="a6" href="#e6">6</a>

In the early 21st century, India proved conclusively that there
was no tradeoff between democracy and miracle economic growth. This
made it look like an excellent bet as a long-term U.S. partner.
</aside>

<p>Second, partly because of its new export dynamism, India's GDP
growth accelerated to 8 percent per year in the early 21st
century. Its savings rate shot up to 30-35 percent of GDP, implying
that it could sustain rapid growth with only minimal dependence on
capital inflows, and so growth could be resilient even in crises when
capital flows dried up (as was proved in 2008-09). Projections of
sustained 8 percent growth revealed that India would become one of the
biggest economies in the world in a few decades, a sea change from its
earlier image as a basket case. New market-friendly government
policies obviously created a climate that made this change possible,
but the main actors implementing the change were corporations and
individuals. Analysts like Tarun Khanna of Harvard have noted that,
whereas China's economic success has been driven largely by
government, India's success has been driven largely by the private
sector.<a class="endnoteref" id="a7" href="#e7">7</a>

<p>Third, the rise of the Indian economy was matched by the dizzying
rise in the size and prestige of the Indian diaspora in the United
States. The number of Indians living in the United States tripled from
one million in 1990 to almost three million by 2011. It was the best
educated of the many immigrant groups in the United States, and
wealthy to boot, so Indian Americans began to matter not just in sheer
numbers but in their political contributions, too. They rose to top
positions in academia, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and
industry. Three Indian Americans won Nobel Prizes. In this manner, the
diaspora helped raise India's "brand value" and clout in the United
States, and made it look like a good strategic partner.<a class="endnoteref" id="a8" href="#e8">8</a>

<p>Fourth, the United States found that it could present India as a
role model for secularism and democracy in a world where religious
terrorism and autocracy remain major issues. As long as India was poor
and slow-growing, its secularism and democracy did not look like roads
to success. But in the early 21st century, India proved conclusively
that there was no tradeoff between democracy and miracle economic
growth. This made it look like an excellent bet as a long-term
U.S. partner, despite many foreign policy differences (for instance,
an all-party resolution in India's Parliament deplored the U.S.
invasion of Iraq in 2003).<a class="endnoteref" id="a9" href="#e9">9</a>

<p>Many foreign policy analysts give credit to George Bush and
Manmohan Singh for forging the new relationship between the United
States and India despite considerable domestic opposition in both
countries. Certainly their individual contributions were considerable,
but they were building on a convergence that had already been forged
by rising business and individual ties for decades. This was crucial
in helping reverse substantial divergences at the political level that
had arisen in past years, first from the Cold War and later from
nuclear non-proliferation.

<aside class="pullquote">
During the Cold War, India developed a quasi-military
relationship with the Soviet Union. But no matter how frosty
governmental relations were, the Indo-U.S.  relationship grew steadily
at the business and individual levels.
</aside>

<p>What's true of Indo-U.S. relations also applies in different
degrees to India's foreign relations across the globe. For instance,
in October 2009, Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao delivered a
lecture at Harvard on "India's Global Position." This provided a grand
tour of India's relations with different regions of the globe, as well
as terrorism, the Doha round of trade negotiations, energy, and
climate change. Like most conventional analyses, the lecture was
almost entirely about government policies and achievements.  It did
not emphasize that India's global footprint, like its footprint in the
United States, had been driven substantially by corporations and
individuals, with the government catching up later. Today, the
government has caught up, and is working together with individuals and
corporations--something that was not always the case.<a class="endnoteref" id="a10" href="#e10">10</a>

The Indian and U.S. governments now hold a formal annual
Indo-U.S. Strategic Dialogue, encompassing political, economic, and
social fields.

<p>At the political and diplomatic levels, many Indo-U.S. differences
continue. India abstained on the U.S.-backed resolution in the UN for
intervening in the Libyan civil war. India opposes the U.S. idea of a
deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan. India has a substantial working
relationship with Iran and relies on it for oil imports, something
Washington is unhappy about. However, person-to-person relations
between the two countries continue to strengthen, so the long-term
foundation of relations continues to grow. This constitutes a
transformation that was unimaginable during the decades of the Cold
War.

<h2>The Cold War and Its Aftermath</h2>

<p>During the Cold War, India developed a quasi-military relationship
with the Soviet Union. This meant that Indo-U.S. governmental
relations ranged from tepid to frosty. In 1971, there was a real
chance of hostilities when the United States sent warships into the
Bay of Bengal in an attempt to thwart Indian troops from overrunning
what was then the Pakistani province of East Pakistan and converting
it into an independent Bangladesh. But no matter how frosty
governmental relations were, the Indo-U.S.  relationship grew steadily
at the business and individual levels.

<p>After the 1971 standoff over Bangladesh, the United States
virtually ended all foreign aid to India save some food aid. This was
a substantial penalty, since the United States had earlier accounted
for the bulk of foreign aid to India from the Aid India Consortium.<a class="endnoteref" id="a11" href="#e11">11</a>

State," Cato Institute Policy Analysis no. 170, May 6, 1992.
</aside>
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union became India's main military supplier, at
fire-sale prices. Soviet aid and technology helped create most
public-sector giants in India. India was chronically short of foreign
exchange thanks to its inward-looking policies, and the Soviet Union
helped out by agreeing to conduct bilateral trade entirely in rupees,
taking rupee payment for arms, equipment, and raw materials (including
oil).

<p>Despite this, the United States remained India's biggest trading
partner by far. IndoU.S. commercial relations strengthened even as
government ones weakened. Many Indian public-sector companies that
started with Soviet technology later switched to Western technology in
order to upgrade. For instance, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., a
public-sector manufacturer of electrical equipment, became much
stronger after switching from Soviet to German technology. India's Oil
and Natural Gas Commission was launched with Soviet assistance, but
later turned to American and French companies for technology.

<p>Even more striking was the growth in Indo-U.S. relations at the
individual level.  Because of the colonial connection, Indian students
going abroad tended to go to Britain for several decades after India's
independence, taking advantage of cheap fees for Commonwealth
students. But when British prime minister Margaret Thatcher ended
those subsidies, thousands of young Indians began to go to the United
States for higher education, taking advantage of scholarships
available for post-graduate studies. Student numbers rose as India
became more prosperous, and in 2010, more than 100,000 Indians entered
U.S. universities, overtaking China as the largest supplier of foreign
stu-7 dents. Many Indian students stayed on in the United States after
completing their studies and went on to occupy important positions in
academia, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley.  The Indian diaspora in the
United States is three million strong today.

India is now on its way to overtaking the United States as the
biggest English-speaking country in the world.
</aside>

<p>Indians seeking to study in or migrate to the United States found
that, having English language skills, they could communicate well with
Americans, who were also more welcoming of immigrants than any other
country. India is now on its way to overtaking the United States as
the biggest Englishspeaking country in the world. No diplomat or
strategist could have concocted any economic advantage as powerful as
the colonial legacy of English. The economic returns to learning
English were always high within India during colonial times. But the
advantage of knowing English has become much bigger with the
globalization of India's economy and the rise of outsourcing.

<p>This fact has been clearly established by researchers Mehtabul
Azam, Aimee Chin, and Nishith Prakash of the Centre for Research and
Analysis of Migration at University College, London. Analyzing data
collected for the India Human Development Survey, 2005, the
researchers found that

<blockquote>
being fluent in English (compared to not speaking any English)
increases hourly wages of men by 34%, which is as much as the return
to completing secondary school and half as much as the return to
completing a Bachelor's degree. Being able to speak a little English
significantly increases male hourly wages 13% . . . More experienced
and more educated workers receive higher returns to English. The
complementarity between English skills and education appears to have
strengthened over time.<a class="endnoteref" id="a12" href="#e12">12</a>

<p>Far from seeking to exploit the colonial language legacy, the
Indian government initially viewed English as an imperial aberration
and sought to abolish it as an official Indian language and replace it
fully with Hindi in 1965. But riots erupted in southern states,
notably Tamil Nadu, which were proud of their own regional languages
and viewed the imposition of Hindi as North-Indian
imperialism. English survived unscathed in India because of this
revolt, a triumph of the people over the government. English
flourished in private schools (parents greatly preferred
English-language schools) even as the language was de-emphasized or
banned in government schools, especially in North India. It should be
no surprise that the software and outsourcing revolution in India
started in South India, and has spread only fitfully to the North.

<p>The rise of English in independent India, despite government
discouragement, turned out to be a major force for
Indo-U.S. relations. Young Indians were attracted by the soft power of
the United States. They loved American movies, music, and literature,
and could absorb this because they knew English. Students going to the
United States found they shared not only the same language as
native-born Americans but interests in music, literature, and movies,
and so integrated effortlessly. Indian students and migrants felt at
home in the United States even when intergovernmental tensions were
high during the Cold War.

<p>By contrast, very few Indians were inclined to learn Russian or
study in the Soviet Union, despite strong intergovernmental relations.
Very few Indians were interested in Soviet films or music. They danced
the twist, shake, and jive. They did not dance the Cossack dance.
Excellent Indo-Soviet governmental relations simply did not translate
into strong ties at the individual level.

<p>The Pew Global Attitudes survey illustrates strikingly how large a
gap can arise between formal government relations and public
attitudes. Pew's annual survey asks people in different countries,
among other things, whether they have a favorable view of the United
States. Pakistan and Turkey have been formal military allies of the
United States, and that indicates closeness at the political
level. Yet the public in those countries has generally had an
unfavorable view of the United States. On the other hand, the Indian
public has generally had a favorable view of the United States despite
historically problematic relations between the two governments and
India's quasi-military links with the Soviet Union during the Cold War
(see Table 1).<a class="endnoteref" id="a13" href="#e13">13</a>

<h2>The 1991 Watershed: Soviet Collapse and Indian Economic
Reform</h2>

<p>In 1991 the Cold war ended and the Soviet Union collapsed. In the
same year, India suffered a major balance-of-payments crisis, and went
to the International Monetary Fund hat-in-hand. It even had to
mortgage its gold reserves, a humiliation and loss of face felt keenly
in a country where attachment to gold was very strong.

<p>Clearly India had to change its economic path. The collapse of the
Soviet Union showed that more socialism and autarky could not be the
way forward. On the other hand, the success of Deng Xiaoping in China
showed that, for large and poor countries, enormous gains could accrue
from marketorientation and globalization. So, India began to gradually
dismantle its jungle of socialist controls and open up to foreign
goods and capital. This opening up steadily but inexorably increased
the scope for Indian individuals and corporations to expand their
interactions with the United States, and indeed, to the whole world.

<p>Indian economic reform began cautiously and hesitantly. The
reformers of 1991 aimed at rescuing a bankrupt economy and increasing
GDP growth. They did not think so far ahead as to imagine that the
reforms would lead to a powerful Indian diaspora of three million in
the United States, or a huge business outsourcing industry, or a big
rush of Indian corporations abroad to become multinationals in their
own right. Yet these consequences ultimately flowed from the end of
the Cold War and the economic reforms that followed.

<p>Many analysts feared that opening up India would lead to the
crushing or takeover of Indian companies by multinationals. As things
turned out, Indian companies held their own in the 1990s, and in the
next decade became multinational corporations in their own right,
acquiring massive business abroad. Rapid economic growth at home was
accompanied by rising Indian corporate clout across the globe.

<p>Computer software and offshore business services were the two areas
where Indian companies became most well-known globally, especially in
the United States. Starting from almost nothing in the early 1990s,
Indian exports of software and business services rose to an estimated
$69 billion in 2011-12.<a class="endnoteref" id="a14" href="#e14">14</a>

Indeed, this instilled fear and alarmism in the United States over the
shift of jobs to India (with TV anchor Lou Dobbs being a prominent
fear-monger). India's success inspired a short-lived American TV
comedy, Outsourced.

<p>A new word, "Bangalored" (meaning losing your job to somebody in
Bangalore, India) entered the dictionary. Most of the U.S. Fortune 500
companies now have operations in India for software and business
services.  Indeed, IBM and Accenture now have more employees in India
than in the United States, and their global competitiveness is
critically dependent on their Indian operations.

<p>For all these fears of India taking away jobs, India's own
investments in the United States between 2004 and 2009 totaled $26.6
billion and created 65,000 U.S. jobs, according to a joint report of
the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Ernst
and Young. In the fiscal years 2009 and 2010, Indian companies made
536 acquisitions abroad, of which 105 were in the United States.<a class="endnoteref" id="a15" href="#e15">15</a>

<h2>How Corporations Expanded India's Footprint Across the Globe</h2>

<p>India's economic liberalization from 1991 onwards catalyzed Indian
corporations and individuals to rapidly expand relations not only with
the United States but with countries across the globe. The role played
by Indian corporations has been nothing short of extraordinary in the
last decade. Indian industrial houses once cowered in fear of being
crushed by U.S. multinationals, but have now become multinationals in
their own rights.  Many have become global giants, making acquisitions
in every continent.

<p>Lakshmi Mittal took over the European giant Arcelor in 2005 to
create the world's biggest steel company. In 2007, Tata Steel took
over the Anglo-Dutch steel giant Corus.  Tata Motors acquired and
turned around Jaguar Land Rover, which had earlier remained deep in
the red, despite efforts at revival by first BMW and then Ford. The
Birla group acquired Novellis of Canada to become the sixth-largest
aluminum company in the world. This was risky--globally, up to 80
percent of acquisitions fail to add value, and acquirers typically
find they have overpaid. The Tata and Birla acquisitions were
especially risky, since they took place at high prices at the very top
of the business cycle. Soon after acquisition, they plunged into the
red because of the Great Recession of 2007-09. But subsequently, all
these acquired companies have turned around. Jaguar Land Rover
reported record profits in 2011, and its acquisition is clearly a
major success. Some analysts still wonder whether the returns on
acquisitions of Corus and Novellis have been commensurate with the
high cost of acquisition.  But dozens of other Indian acquisitions--
notably those in the Lakhmi Mittal steel empire--have been
unambiguously successful.<a class="endnoteref" id="a16" href="#e16">16</a>

<p>Historically, the Indian government frowned on Indian corporations
investing abroad; this was interpreted as depriving India of
much-needed capital. In the 1980s, Indian companies could invest
abroad only in kind (machinery and equipment to be supplied to a
factory in lieu of equity), not in cash. That changed in the 1990s,
but there remained stringent curbs on the ability of Indian companies
to raise money abroad.  These were gradually eased, mainly in the
early 21st century. The government thought this would make it easier
for Indian companies to find global funds for investment in
India. Nobody anticipated that the result would be massive takeovers
of global giants by Indian companies. This was a classic case of
economic opening-up creating what diplomats and planners never
envisaged: a huge Indian footprint across the globe.

<p>Other developing countries have a comparative advantage in cheap
labor. But Indian companies have proved through successful foreign
acquisitions that they have a comparative advantage in corporate
management. That holds enormous potential for increasing India's
global footprint and influence.

<aside class="pullquote">
No diplomat or strategist could have concocted any economic advantage
as powerful as the colonial legacy of English.
</aside>

<p>Indian companies in both the public sector (ONGC, BPCL, GAIL) and
private sector (Reliance, Essar, Videocon) have made massive
acquisitions in oil and gas companies abroad, partly to share in the
hydrocarbon output and partly to acquire know-how to be used later in
India. The Reliance Group, for instance, has acquired large stakes in
three shale gas companies in the United States, with a view to
becoming a shale gas driller itself.

<p>Economists Aaditya Mattoo and Arvind Subramanian have demonstrated
that, while foreign direct investment (FDI) into China is far higher
than into India, a different picture emerges in relation to outward
foreign direct investment (FDI; that is, investments by Indians or
Chinese abroad). Measuring FDI outflows as a proportion of GDP, India
overtook China by a big margin between 2005 and 2008. India's FDI/GDP
ratio has subsequently dipped below China's (see Figure 1), but is
nevertheless an extraordinary achievement, unmatched by any other
country at a similar early stage of development.<a class="endnoteref" id="a17" href="#e17">17</a>

<h2>Box 2. Tata Group Becomes the Largest Employer in the UK</h2>

<p>The Economist, the British weekly, revealed in its issue of
September 10, 2011, that the Tata Group had become the largest
private-sector employer in the United Kingdom.  This was an
astonishing achievement, unmatched even by China. It turned
conventional economic theory upside down. Foreign investment is
supposed to flow from rich to poor countries and create jobs in the
latter, but Indian corporations have proved that the opposite can not
only happen, but even become a dominant trend.

<p>Tata's first acquisition in the UK was of Tetley, the beverages
group specializing in tea. Later Tata acquired Brunner Mond, the
parent of what used to be Imperial Chemical Industries. The really big
acquisition was in 2007 of Corus, a British steelmaker with a
production capacity of 18 million tons. In technological terms, the
Tata Group's most sophisticated acquisition was of Jaguar Land
Rover. These companies account for 40,000 employees in the UK. Add
Tata's service industries, mainly TCS (a software and consulting
company), and the group has 45,000 employees in the UK, making it
Britain's top employer, just ahead of British Aerospace.<a class="endnoteref" id="a18" href="#e18">18</a>

<p>China's outward FDI reflects, in part, its huge mercantilist
surpluses--that is, trade surpluses arising from manipulated exchange
rates have led to an excess accumulation of capital that then has to
be invested abroad. In part, the outward FDI of China also aims at
securing sources of raw materials such as copper and oil. India,
however, has no mercantilist surpluses, and its outward FDI has been
financed almost entirely by borrowing abroad, which shows the
confidence of global lenders in Indian managerial skills. Unlike
China, India cannot really be called an exporter of capital. Rather,
it leverages its managerial skills to raise foreign loans for foreign
acquisitions. This is how Tata Steel, a relative pygmy, could acquire
Corus, which was six times its size in terms of steel output. Tata did
not have the cash, but had the required drive and skills to convince
the "whale" that it would benefit from being swallowed by the
"minnow." This demonstration of global managerial skills has had an
unanticipated corollary. As Indian companies have become big global
acquirers, they have also become big global employers.  Indeed, the
Tata Group has become the largest private-sector employer in the UK
(see Box 2).

and frugal engineering. Neither term was heard of a decade ago.

<p>"Jugaad" is the art of endless improvisation to overcome obstacles
of all sorts. Indian companies that managed to survive the
license-permit raj of socialism for decades developed all sorts of
skills in survival and growth in inhospitable conditions. Once
presented with a better policy environment, they soared, in India and
abroad.<a class="endnoteref" id="a20" href="#e20">20</a>

</aside>
Jugaad is an amoral concept: it includes ways of "managing"
politicians and bureaucrats, including intricate forms of
corruption. This aspect has naturally drawn much criticism.  Yet the
record suggests that Indian companies that seemed to succeed at home
only through political cronyism were later able to flourish in
decontrolled sectors and across the world. For instance, the
construction company GMR was widely accused of crony capitalism in
building the New Delhi airport terminal--the contract conditions were
changed more than once. Yet GMR subsequently won contracts for new air
terminals in Istanbul and Male (in the Maldives). This is seen by some
analysts as evidence that any company good enough to manage Indian
politicians and bureaucrats has developed world-class managerial
skills.

<p>India has become famous for "frugal engineering," which means
producing goods and services that are not just 10 percent cheaper than
others, but 50-90 percent cheaper. Some examples come from management
guru C. K. Prahalad's book The Fortune at the Bottom of the
Pyramid. Carlos Ghosn, head of Renault-Nissan, says his company came

The Nano, built by the Tata group, is the world's cheapest car,

<h2>Beyond Non-Alignment: India's New Footprint in the Third
World</h2>

<p>For decades after independence, India was among the foremost
proponents of anticolonialism and Third World solidarity. It was a key
force in the G-77 group of developing countries, which aimed to
negotiate trade and aid concessions from the West in pursuance of what
came to be called "development economics." But affirmations of
solidarity did very little for economic relations between India and
other developing countries. For instance, in 1967, three stalwarts of
the Non-Aligned Movement--Jawaharlal Nehru, Josip Tito, and Gamal
Nasser--signed an agreement on tripartite cooperation between India,
Yugoslavia, and the United Arab Republic (a temporary combination of
Egypt, Syria, and Yemen). This was touted as a model with strong
political roots for promoting "South-South Relations" between
developing countries. But this political solidarity never translated
into strong economic ties. These three countries had few economic
complementarities, and their socialist policies discouraged the
private sector and foreign investment. India's professed aim of
self-sufficiency meant deemphasizing trade and promoting import
substitution. One result was that India developed its own longstaple
cotton varieties and stopped importing Giza cotton from Egypt, leading
to a collapse of bilateral trade. Despite all the talk of Third World
solidarity, Indian foreign trade until 1991was overwhelmingly with
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
and what used to be the Soviet-led Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance. Trade with other Third World countries remained very
modest, and trade with China was almost nonexistent.

<p>But India's trade pattern got diversified dramatically after it
opted for outwardlooking economic reforms in 1991.<a class="endnoteref" id="a22" href="#e22">22</a>

Today, the United Arab Emirates and China have become India's biggest
trading partners.  The United Arab Emirates connection will surprise
many; it is explained by the fact that a lot of Indian trade with
Pakistan and Iran is routed via Dubai for political reasons.

<p>Indian commercial contact with Latin America was historically very
limited, and there were hardly any regular shipping services. But the
meteoric rise of Indian business then transformed matters. The first
push came from steel baron Lakshmi Mittal, who in the 1980s had
started with a tiny mini-steel plant in Indonesia. When a
government-owned steel plant in Trinidad went bankrupt, Mittal boldly
leased it in 1989, and later acquired it. His success in this endeavor
gave him the credentials for acquiring Sibalsa, Mexico's third-largest
steel plant, when it was privatized in 1992. He turned around Sibalsa
too, and this became the launching pad for an acquisition spree the
likes of which India (and the world) has never seen. The company's
website gives this thumbnail sketch:

<aside class="pullquote">
Mittal's success could hardly be a better example of a business
creating a global imprint wider and deeper than anything achievable by
conventional diplomacy, and it inspired other Indian companies to
follow suit.
</aside>

<blockquote>

<p>Mittal Steel's rapid growth since 1989 has been the result of
combining a successful consolidation strategy with a number of
significant acquisitions.

<p>Since setting up operations in Trinidad and Tobago in 1989, some of
its major acquisitions are Siderurgica del Balsas (Mexico) in 1992,
Sidbec (Canada) in 1994, Karmet (Kazakhstan) and Hamburger Stahlwerke
(Germany) in 1995, Thyssen Duisburg (Germany) in 1997, Inland Steel
(US) in 1998, Unimetal (France) in 1999, Sidex (Romania) and Annaba
(Algeria) in 2001, Nova Hut (Czech Republic) in 2003, BH Steel
(Bosnia), Balkan Steel (Macedonia), PHS (Poland) and Iscor (South
Africa) in 2004, ISG (US), Kryvorizhstal (Ukraine), as well as a
significant interest in Hunan Valin Steel (China) in 2005, and three
Stelco Inc. subsidiaries (Canada) in 2006.

<p>Arcelor was created in February 2002 through the merger of Arbed
(Luxembourg) founded in 1911, Aceralia (Spain) and Usinor
(France). Arcelor also had major steel production facilities in
Belgium, Germany, Italy, Brazil and Argentina.

<p>Arcelor acquired a controlling interest in Companhia Siderurgica
Tubarao (now a part of ArcelorMittal Brasil) in 2004, Huta Warszawa
(Poland) in 2005, a controlling interest in Sonasid (Morocco), as well
as Dofasco (Canada) in 2006.

<p>At the time of the merger with Mittal Steel, Arcelor was the second
largest steel producer in the world.

<p>In 2007 the newly merged ArcelorMittal continued to pursue an
expansive growth strategy, with 35 transactions announced worldwide.

<p>At the beginning of 2008 ArcelorMittal continued to make
investments, with significant transactions announced in Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, France, Russia, South Africa, Sweden,
Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the US and Venezuela, the majority of
which were completed. But in light of the deteriorating economic
situation during 2008, ArcelorMittal suspended most investment
activity by the end of the year.

<p>Post-crisis, ArcelorMittal has cautiously restarted certain
projects to capture growth in key emerging markets and mining. Capital
expenditure on mining doubled in 2011 to almost US$1.3 billion, as the
group embarked on a major development programme aimed at expanding
existing mines and developing new ones.<a class="endnoteref" id="a23" href="#e23">23</a>

<p>There could hardly be a better example of a business house creating
a global imprint wider and deeper than anything achievable by
conventional diplomacy. Mittal's success inspired other Indian
companies to follow suit. Moreover, Mittal's ability to turn around
bankrupt companies gave companies around the globe the confidence that
they would benefit by being acquired by Indian groups (like Tata,
Birla, and Mahindra). That confidence has subsequently been
vindicated.

<p>TCS, India's biggest software company, has operations in eight
Latin American companies ranging from Mexico to Argentina.  Tata
Motors is making buses in a joint venture with Marcopolo in Brazil,
with future plans to assemble Tata's Nano and Jaguar cars. Indian
pharmaceutical companies such as Ranbaxy, Glenmark, and Dr. Reddy's
Labs have joint ventures and subsidiaries in several countries in the
region.

<p>Much bigger is the increase in India's footprint in Africa. Bharti
Airtel is now providing telecom in 15 African countries after taking
over Zain's operations there.  In Kenya, Essar has acquired oil
refineries and the Khaitan group has acquired tea gardens. Many Indian
companies have rushed into Mozambique to exploit coal deposits newly
discovered there. Zambia's Konkola mine, the largest in Africa, was
once sold to a multinational mining firm, Anglo American plc., which
failed to revive it. Then it was acquired by Indian magnate Anil
Aggarwal, who converted it into a money-spinner.  Tata, Reliance, and
Mahindra are among the 96 Indian firms currently investing in South
Africa, and cumulative Indian investments there exceed $100 million.

<h2>The Chinese Challenge</h2>

<p>Commercial relations between India and China were virtually
nonexistent until the 1990s, yet China (including Hong Kong) has now
become India's largest trading partner (see Table 2). This is a huge
and unanticipated change. The two-way trade turnover was $82 billion
in 2010-11, way ahead of Indo-U.S. trade of $45.6 billion.
Surprisingly, India's second biggest trading partner was not the
United States, but the United Arab Emirates, with a $67.1 billion
trade turnover. This is partly a statistical illusion: large amounts
of Indian trade with Pakistan and Iran are routed via the United Arab

<p>Political relations have become tenser, yet are by no means
unfriendly. The main reason is that the two countries decided in the
1980s not to let politics stand in the way of normalizing other
relations. As a consequence, business relations have flourished beyond
the wildest dreams of analysts or the two governments, even as
political relations have worsened.

<p>This has some limited resemblance to the evolution of
Indo-U.S. relations during the Cold War. It leads to an interesting
question: Will business and individual relations between India and
China grow so strongly that they create a solid foundation for
political amity, and later force governments to catch up, as in the
Indo-U.S. case?

<p>It is easy to spot major differences in the two cases. The biggest
difference is that the Chinese do not speak English, do not attract
Indians with soft power, and have no interest at all in Indian
immigrants. Hence, peopleto-people contacts are very limited and don't
have much potential for expansion. On the commercial side, India had a
trade surplus with the United States during the Cold War, and exported
many manufactures to it. But India currently runs a huge trade deficit
with China, and Indian businessmen complain that this is because of
unfair Chinese subsidies and currency manipulation. Dozens of
antidumping suits have successfully been brought by Indian companies
against Chinese exports (though this owes something to Indian
protectionism). India overwhelmingly exports raw materials (mainly
iron ore) to China, while importing manufactures (mainly telecom and
electrical equipment), and critics say this is reminiscent of the old
colonial relationship between India and Britain.  India has expressed
security concerns about Chinese telecom equipment, which may have
embedded spying capacity, and so limited its entry.

<p>Indian companies wishing to invest in China say they face several
informal barriers. China's huge demand for iron ore has certainly
boosted Indian exports, yet has also led to large-scale illegal mining
in many Indian states, culminating in formal export curbs by some
state governments and the Indian Supreme Court. China may be a large
export destination for India, but India accounts for a small fraction
of China's exports, so the relationship is asymmetrical--China
dominates in quality and quantity, and is less dependent on India than
India is on China.<a class="endnoteref" id="a28" href="#e28">28</a>

<p>These are good reasons for going slow 
on the notion that business and individual 
ties can improve the Sino-Indian political 
relationship any time soon. Yet it looks to 
be possible--if we look forward a decade or 
two. The countries of the West look likely to 
grow much more slowly in coming decades. 
While the growth of China and India may 
also slow down as part of a global trend, they 
will still grow relatively fast compared to the 
West. If so, the two countries will increasingly become more important for one another 
commercially. This could have political consequences, just as happened to India and the 
United States in the last two decades. India 
has the potential to become a very important market for China, and this could, at 
some point, become important enough to
change Chinese political attitudes, even on 
thorny issues like the border.

<h2>The Rising Importance of the Indian Diaspora</h2>

<p>A much-neglected contributor to India's growing footprint in the
United States and the rest of the world has been the rise of the
Indian diaspora, estimated at over 30 million strong. In the 19th
century, many Indians were taken by British colonialists as indentured
laborers to British possessions ranging from Asia, to Africa, to the
Caribbean. Indian traders accompanied these workers and became
commercially important in these regions. Indians also became important
as doctors, shopkeepers, and motel owners across the United States and
United Kingdom. Millions of Indians went to the Persian Gulf to work
after oil-rich countries became wealthy in the 1970s.

<p>However, an important new development in this diaspora is the rise
of highly skilled Indians in the United States. Many first came to the
United States as university students and stayed on, rising up the
ladders of academia and industry. Today over 100,000 students come
annually from India to the United States, constituting the
secondlargest foreign-student community after the Chinese.<a class="endnoteref" id="a29" href="#e29">29</a>

<p>AnnaLee Saxenian of Berkeley University was among the first to
highlight the stellar role of Asians--of Indian and Chinese origin--in
Silicon Valley. These groups accounted for one-third of the scientific
and engineering workforce in Silicon Valley. Indeed, she found that
chief executive officers of Asian origin ran a quarter of all
high-tech firms in the region. Rather than a "brain drain" from the
originating countries, Saxenian detected "brain circulation" as
immigrants returned to their home countries to take advantage of
promising opportunities there, and also played a key role in building
markets in their native countries from a California base. She
concluded that this two-way exchange of brainpower had greatly
benefited both India and California.<a class="endnoteref" id="a30" href="#e30">30</a>

<p>NR Narayana Murthy of Infosys and Azim Premji of Wipro are perhaps
the best known returnees who created world-class software companies in
India. India could never have developed a comparative advantage in
software on its own: politicians instinctively opposed
computerization, fearing it would lead to job losses, and
public-sector domination of the economy meant there was little
competitive pressure to computerize for better customer service. So,
software engineers did not have enough work within India for building
major new skills. This led to what was called body-shopping--Indian
software engineers were hired to work onsite in projects in the United
States and other foreign locations, where they acquired considerable
skills that they took back to India. In the 1990s, more than
two-thirds of the income of Indian software companies came from work
done onsite in countries such as the United States, and only one-third
came from work in India. The two ratios have now reversed--a major
success of brain circulation.

<p>Another returnee, Pramod Bhasin of General Electric, was the
pioneer of outsourcing clerical and other white-collar functions to
India. He made Genepact--the outsourcing subsidiary of GE--the biggest
such player in India, and inspired hundreds of others to follow
suit. Dozens of scientists have returned to India to join research
centers set up by a host of multinational companies ranging from
General Electric and Microsoft to Suzuki and Bosch. Bond rating
agencies like Moody's and Standard and Poor's started by rating Indian
commercial paper and ended up using India as a base for ratings
internationally.

<p>Indian business families sent their children to study business
abroad, and they brought back skills that have been crucial to
modernizing Indian industry. All the professions now boast a long list
of returnees.  Many economists who helped drive India's economic
reforms--such as Montek Singh 17 Ahluwalia, Shankar Acharya, Rakesh
Mohan, Vijay Kelkar, and Arvind Virmani--were returnees. Socialist
politicians who fulminated against elite private schools were
nevertheless hypocritical enough to send their children to the United
States and the UK for education, and that provided unexpected
dividends when the time for economic reform came: the children
arguably helped change the attitudes of their political parents as
much--or more than--any seminars or debates. In sum, what was originally
called the brain drain became a brain circulation of immense value to
India.

<p>A joint study by Duke University and the University of
California-Berkeley revealed that during 1995-2005, immigrants founded
a quarter of all engineering and technology start-ups in the United
States, of which 26 percent were founded by Indian immigrants. In the
last decade, Indian Americans founded more new high-tech firms than
immigrants from the UK, China, Taiwan, and Japan combined.<a class="endnoteref" id="a31" href="#e31">31</a>

<p>Three Indian Americans have won Nobel Prizes (Gobind Khurana in
1968 for medicine, S. Chandra Shekhar in 1983 for physics, and
V. Ramakrishnan in 2009 for chemistry). Two Indian Americans, Bobby
Jindal and Nikki Haley, have become state governors (of Louisiana and
South Carolina, respectively). Hundreds of Indian Americans occupy top
positions in academia (for example, Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia
University and Avinash Dixit of Princeton University), in corporations
(Vikram Pandit, former CEO of Citigroup; and Indra Nooyi, CEO of
Pepsi), media (Fareed Zakaria, former editor of Newsweek
International) and Wall Street.  The head of Standard and Poor's, when
it downgraded U.S. government bonds from AAA in August 2011, was Deven
Sharma.

<p>Indeed, it's amusing to note that in Wall Street's biggest scam
regarding insider trading by the securities firm Galleon, the chief
accused were Raj Rajaratnam and Rajat Gupta, the government prosecutor
was Preet Bharara, and the major witnesses included Rajiv Goel and
Anil Kumar. From the names, you might have thought this was a scam in
India. In fact, it simply showed how large was the footprint of the
Indian diaspora on Wall Street. (Technically, Rajaratnam is a Sri
Lankan, but of Tamil origin from India.)

<p>The Indian diaspora has become an important source of India's own
economic strength. Overseas remittances from the diaspora were under
$2 billion a year in the 1980s but have risen strongly in recent
times, totaling $66.13 billion in 2011-12, or 3 percent of GDP.<a class="endnoteref" id="a33" href="#e33">33</a>

This drives home how much more
important the diaspora has become than the Indian government in
harnessing foreign-exchange flows from abroad and stabilizing the
balance of payments. Corporate inflows have been far bigger, too, than
foreign aid, and in 2011-12 foreign direct investment totaled $46.8
billion--a new record. Here again the direct contribution of
governments was dwarfed by that of individuals and corporations. The
government was most effective when it facilitated the latter.

<p>The Indian diaspora has long urged the Indian government to allow
dual citizenship. The government has demurred, fearing this could
become a route for infiltration by terrorists or Pakistan agents. But
it decided to issue Person of India Origin (PIO) cards that provided
free entry into India for 15 years for foreign citizens of Indian
origin, and entitled them to own property in India and enjoy other
privileges denied to foreign nationals in general. Later, this was
upgraded to an Overseas Citizen of India passport, proving lifetime
free entry into India, and waiving the PIO requirement to register
with the police for stays of over 180 days.  This is more than just an
ethno-nostalgic initiative: it has solid foreign policy motives
too. It seeks to bind the diaspora closer to their original homeland,
and thus become a more committed local lobby.

<p>Obviously, Indian Americans are Americans first and foremost, and
the Indian government would be unwise to think it can ever manipulate
them for narrow ends. But the power of ethnic lobbies in U.S. politics
is well established. The Greek American lobby has ensured that the
United States tilts towards Greece in its disputes with Turkey
(notably over Cyprus). The anti-Castro Cuban American lobby has long
ensured a hard-line U.S.  policy toward communist Cuba.

<p>Indians in the United States have, in past decades, been so divided
by religion and region as to not constitute a homogeneous
lobby. Indeed, Kashmiris and Sikhs in the United States often backed
secessionist movements in India and acted as anti-Indian lobbies. But
today the secessionist fringe is fading away and Indian Americans
appear to be a much more homogeneous lot. The rapid rise in their
sheer numbers gives them political visibility and clout. Besides, they
are highly educated, articulate, and well off, and have become a
rising source of financial contributions for U.S. politicians. That
has a positive knock-on effect on Indo-U.S. relations. Encouraged by
the success of Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, six Indian Americans ran
for the House of Representatives in November 2012, and one of them won
(Ami Bera of California).<a class="endnoteref" id="a36" href="#e36">36</a>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Indian foreign policy has long been based on the notion that
politicians and diplomats drive international relations. Diplomats
will readily agree that corporations and individuals matter, too, but
they have seriously underplayed the role of these while exaggerating
that of politicians, military brass, and diplomats. India today has
become a country that matters globally mainly because of foundations
created substantially by individuals and corporations. During the Cold
War, Indo-U.S. political relations were cool, but commercial and
person-to-person ties expanded fast, laying the ground for a major
political rapprochement after the Cold War ended. Sino-Indian
relations have also grown explosively on the commercial side in the
last decade, even as political relations have cooled. There is much
less scope for business and individual relations to drive the
political process in Sino-Indian relations, yet it needs to be kept in
mind and encouraged in every way.

<p>Indian politicians have historically worried endlessly about the
brain drain of Indian emigrants, and the supposed loss it imposes on
India. Yet India's recent success owes much to the return flow of
Indians who had gone abroad. What initially looked like the brain
drain has become brain circulation: the secret is to create conditions
at home that attract returnees. Those that remain abroad also serve
very important purposes.  The Indian diaspora has provided steadily
rising remittances, which touched $66.13 billion in 2011-12.<a class="endnoteref" id="a37" href="#e37">37</a>

This flow remained steady in financial crises when foreign investors
were fleeing India, as in 1997-98 and 2008-09, and so was invaluable
in stabilizing the balance of payments. The success of the disapora in
the United States also provides major brand-image advantages to
India. Finally, the diaspora constitutes a formidable political lobby
in the United States, and hence is a great foreign policy asset.

Indian foreign policy should aim to maximize the gains of
interdependence, not autonomy.

<p>Far from recognizing these advantages of free movement, Indian
politicians continue 19 seeking curbs. India's health minister, Ghulam
Nabi Azad, recently declared that Indian medical students going to the
United States would have to sign bonds and forfeit them if they did
not return to India after their studies.<a class="endnoteref" id="a38" href="#e38">38</a>

He claimed that the United States required a "No Objection"
Certificate from India for students entering U.S. colleges, and said
that as a condition for such certification, he would tell the United
States not to let Indian students stay on to practice medicine after
completing their studies. In India's socialist past, medical students
were indeed asked to sign an affidavit promising to return, but this
proved unenforceable.  World Health Organization guidelines say there
should be free movement of doctors globally. Indeed, the UN
Declaration of Human Rights says that every human has the right to
leave his country. But Azad remains in narrow pursuit of the old idea
of trying to keep all Indian professionals caged in India, believing
that this self-sufficient cage is more important than interdependence.
In many other fields, Indians going abroad have returned to take
advantage of huge new opportunities created by economic reforms.  The
lesson for Azad and others of his ilk is clear: create more
opportunities at home, not more barriers to emigration.

<p>India's favorable global image today owes much to corporate
initiatives that the government did not, and could not have, planned,
such as Lakshmi Mittal's creation of the world's largest steel empire
or the Tata group's emergence as the biggest private-sector employer
in the UK. Yet politicians and intellectuals in India continue to be
fascinated by self-sufficiency and autonomy, approaches that dragged
India down and kept it poor for decades.

<p>In the 1990s, many Indian politicians and intellectuals wanted
India to leave the World Trade Organization when that organization
insisted on imposing intellectual property rights (IPR) on all members
in the Uruguay Round of negotiations. These critics claimed that
Indian industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, would be
maimed or killed by IPR rules. This proved false; Indian industry
actually did very well after accepting the new WTO rules. Indeed, many
of India's most dynamic industries turned out to be those for whom IPR
is actually vital: computer software, pharmaceuticals, automotive
design, and research and development.

<p>Despite two decades of economic reform, there is insufficient
recognition in India of the importance of global integration and
interdependence as a source of strength. The emphasis of the
government and policy analysts tends to be on narrower, shorter-term
calculations that seek to maximize autonomy of action. A recent
influential foreign policy strategic paper from India's Centre for
Policy Research and National Defence College, which had inputs from
national security advisers, top diplomats, and army brass, was titled
"Nonalignment 2.0." While containing many good proposals for a
globalized and open economy, the very title reflected Cold War
nostalgia. The paper proposed that the key thrust of future foreign
policy should be to maximize India's space for autonomy of
action. This missed the point that becoming integrated into the global
economy--something essential to economic success--means emphasizing
interdependence over autonomy and reaping the gains of global
integration over those of self-sufficiency. The paper made no mention
of the Indian diaspora at all--a major omission.<a class="endnoteref" id="a39" href="#e39">39</a>

However, it correctly highlighted the need to keep the Indian economy
relatively open and integrated with the global economy, so that
economic growth will be rapid and opportunities will proliferate. A
strong economy is vital for a successful foreign policy. And economic
strength requires major encouragement of business and person-to-person
exchanges.

<p>In coming years, Indian foreign policy should aim to maximize the
gains of interdependence, not autonomy. This means liberalizing Indian
rules and policies to give corporations and individuals the fullest
scope to expand their footprint at home and around the globe. It also
means entering into bilateral, regional, and global agreements that 20
promote business and personal exchanges.  India's diplomats should
certainly drive a hard bargain to maximize its interests in
international, regional, and bilateral agreements. It should keep some
wiggle room for autonomous action even while binding itself and its
economic partners to newly agreedupon rules. But creating wiggle room
is a tactic, not a grand strategy. India's grand strategy must aim at
maximizing gains through intelligent global interdependence, thus
creating myriad opportunities for individuals and corporations to
change India, and indeed, the world.
