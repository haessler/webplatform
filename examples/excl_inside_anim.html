riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,
brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle
and Environs.

Sir Tristram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea, had passencore
rearrived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy isthmus of
Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war: nor had topsawyer's
rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse to Laurens County's
gorgios while they went doublin their mumper all the time: nor avoice
from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to tauftauf thuartpeatrick: not yet,
though venissoon after, had a kidscad buttended a bland old isaac: not
yet, though all's fair in vanessy, were sosie sesthers wroth with
twone nathandjoe.  Rot a peck of pa's malt had Jhem or Shen brewed by
arclight and rory end to the regginbrow was to be seen ringsome on the
aquaface.

The fall of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and
later on life down through all christian minstrelsy.  The great fall
of the offwall entailed at such short notice the pftjschute of
Finnegan, erse solid man, that the humptyhillhead of humself prumptly
sends an unquiring one well to the west in quest of his tumptytumtoes:
and their upturnpikepointandplace is at the knock out in the park
where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst
loved livvy.

What clashes here of wills gen wonts, oystrygods gaggin fishygods!
Br&eacute;kkek K&eacute;kkek K&eacute;kkek K&eacute;kkek!  K&oacute;ax
K&oacute;ax K&oacute;ax!  Ualu Ualu Ualu!  Quaouauh!  Where the
Baddelaries partisans are still out to mathmaster Malachus Micgranes
and the Verdons catapelting the camibalistics out of the Whoyteboyce
of Hoodie Head.  Assiegates and boomeringstroms.  Sod's brood, be me
fear!  Sanglorians, save!  Arms apeal with larms, appalling.
Killykillkilly: a toll, a toll.  What chance cuddleys, what cashels
aired and ventilated!  What bidimetoloves sinduced by what
tegotetabsolvers!  What true feeling for their's hayair with what
strawng voice of false jiccup!  O here here how hoth sprowled met the
duskt the father of fornicationists but, (O my shining stars and
body!)  how hath fanespanned most high heaven the skysign of soft
advertisement!  But was iz?  Iseut?  Ere were sewers?  The oaks of ald
now they lie in peat yet elms leap where askes lay.  Phall if you but
will, rise you must: and none so soon either shall the pharce for the
nunce come to a setdown secular phoenish.

Bygmester Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand, freemen's maurer, lived in
the broadest way immarginable in his rushlit toofarback for messuages
before joshuan judges had given us numbers or Helviticus committed
deuteronomy (one yeastyday he sternely struxk his tete in a tub for to
watsch the future of his fates but ere he swiftly stook it out again,
by the might of moses, the very water was eviparated and all the
guenneses had met their exodus so that ought to show you what a
pentschanjeuchy chap he was!)  and during mighty odd years this man of
hod, cement and edifices in Toper's Thorp piled buildung supra
buildung pon the banks for the livers by the Soangso.

He addle liddle phifie Annie ugged the little craythur.  Wither
hayre in honds tuck up your part inher.  Oftwhile balbulous, mithre
ahead, with goodly trowel in grasp and ivoroiled overalls which he
habitacularly fondseed, like Haroun Childeric Eggeberth he would
caligulate by multiplicables the alltitude and malltitude until he
seesaw by neatlight of the liquor wheretwin 'twas born, his roundhead
staple of other days to rise in undress maisonry upstanded
(joygrantit!), a waalworth of a skyerscape of most eyeful hoyth
entowerly, erigenating from next to nothing and celescalating the
himals and all, hierarchitectitiptitoploftical, with a burning bush
abob off its baubletop and with larrons o'toolers clittering up and
tombles a'buckets clottering down.

Of the first was he to bare arms and a name: Wassaily Booslaeugh of
Riesengeborg.  His crest of huroldry, in vert with ancillars,
troublant, argent, a hegoak, poursuivant, horrid, horned.  His
scutschum fessed, with archers strung, helio, of the second.  Hootch
is for husbandman handling his hoe.  Hohohoho, Mister Finn, you're
going to be Mister Finnagain!  Comeday morm and, O, you're vine!
Sendday's eve and, ah, you're vinegar!  Hahahaha, Mister Funn, you're
going to be fined again!

What then agentlike brought about that tragoady thundersday this
municipal sin business?  Our cubehouse still rocks as earwitness to
the thunder of his arafatas but we hear also through successive ages
that shebby choruysh of unkalified muzzlenimiissilehims that would
blackguardise the whitestone ever hurtleturtled out of heaven.  Stay
us wherefore in our search for tighteousness, O Sustainer, what time
we rise and when we take up to toothmick and before we lump down upown
our leatherbed and in the night and at the fading of the stars!  For a
nod to the nabir is better than wink to the wabsanti.  Otherways
wesways like that provost scoffing bedoueen the jebel and the jpysian
sea.

Cropherb the crunchbracken shall decide.  Then we'll know if the
feast is a flyday.  She has a gift of seek on site and she allcasually
ansars helpers, the dreamydeary.  Heed!  Heed!  It may half been a
missfired brick, as some say, or it mought have been due to a
collupsus of his back promises, as others looked at it.  (There extand
by now one thousand and one stories, all told, of the same).  But so
sore did abe ite ivvy's holired abbles, (what with the wallhall's
horrors of rollsrights, carhacks, stonengens, kisstvanes, tramtrees,
fargobawlers, autokinotons, hippohobbilies, streetfleets,
tournintaxes, megaphoggs, circuses and wardsmoats and basilikerks and
aeropagods and the hoyse and the jollybrool and the peeler in the coat
and the mecklenburk bitch bite at his ear and the merlinburrow
burrocks and his fore old porecourts, the bore the more, and his
blightblack workingstacks at twelvepins a dozen and the noobibusses
sleighding along Safetyfirst Street and the derryjellybies snooping
around Tell-No-Tailors' Corner and the fumes and the hopes and the
strupithump of his ville's indigenous romekeepers, homesweepers,
domecreepers, thurum and thurum in fancymud murumd and all the uproor
from all the aufroofs, a roof for may and a reef for hugh butt under
his bridge suits tony) wan warning Phill filt tippling full.

His howd feeled heavy, his hoddit did shake.  (There was a wall of
course in erection) Dimb!  He stottered from the latter.  Damb!  he
was dud.  Dumb!  Mastabatoom, mastabadtomm, when a mon merries his
lute is all long.  For whole the world to see.

Shize?  I should shee!  Macool, Macool, orra whyi deed ye diie?  of a
trying thirstay mournin?  Sobs they sighdid at Fillagain's
chrissormiss wake, all the hoolivans of the nation, prostrated in
their consternation and their duodisimally profusive plethora of
ululation.  There was plumbs and grumes and cheriffs and citherers and
raiders and cinemen too.

And the all gianed in with the shoutmost shoviality.  Agog and
magog and the round of them agrog.  To the continuation of that
celebration until Hanandhunigan's extermination!  Some in kinkin
corass, more, kankan keening.  Belling him up and filling him down.
He's stiff but he's steady is Priam Olim!  'Twas he was the dacent
gaylabouring youth.

Sharpen his pillowscone, tap up his bier!  E'erawhere in this whorl
would ye hear sich a din again?  With their deepbrow fundigs and the
dusty fidelios.  They laid him brawdawn alanglast bed.  With a
bockalips of finisky fore his feet.  And a barrowload of guenesis hoer
his head.  Tee the tootal of the fluid hang the twoddle of the
fuddled, O!

Hurrah, there is but young gleve for the owl globe wheels in view
which is tautaulogically the same thing.  Well, Him a being so on the
flounder of his bulk like an overgrown babeling, let wee peep, see, at
Hom, well, see peegee ought he ought, platterplate.  Hum!  From
Shopalist to Bailywick or from ashtun to baronoath or from Buythebanks
to Roundthehead or from the foot of the bill to ireglint's eye he
calmly extensolies.  And all the way (a horn!)  from fiord to fjell
his baywinds' oboboes shall wail him rockbound (hoahoahoah!)  in
swimswamswum and all the livvylong night, the delldale dalppling
night, the night of bluerybells, her flittaflute in tricky trochees (O
carina!  O carina!)  wake him.

With her issavan essavans and her patterjackmartins about all them
inns and ouses.  Tilling a teel of a tum, telling a toll of a teary
turty Taubling.  Grace before Glutton.  For what we are, gifs a gross
if we are, about to believe.  So pool the begg and pass the kish for
crawsake.  Omen.  So sigh us.  Grampupus is fallen down but grinny
sprids the boord.  Whase on the joint of a desh?  Finfoefom the Fush.
Whase be his baken head?  A loaf of Singpantry's Kennedy bread.  And
whase hitched to the hop in his tayle?  A glass of Danu U'Dunnell's
foamous olde Dobbelin ayle.  But, lo, as you would quaffoff his
fraudstuff and sink teeth through that pyth of a flowerwhite bodey
behold of him as behemoth for he is noewhemoe.  Finiche!  Only a
fadograph of a yestern scene.  Almost rubicund Salmosalar, ancient
fromout the ages of the Agapemonides, he is smolten in our mist,
woebecanned and packt away.  So that meal's dead off for summan,
schlook, schlice and goodridhirring.

Yet may we not see still the brontoichthyan form outlined
aslumbered, even in our own nighttime by the sedge of the troutling
stream that Bronto loved and Brunto has a lean on.  Hiccubat edilis.
Apud libertinam parvulam.  Whatif she be in flags or flitters,
reekierags or sundyechosies, with a mint of mines or beggar a
pinnyweight.  Arrah, sure, we all love little Anny Ruiny, or, we mean
to say, lovelittle Anna Rayiny, when unda her brella, mid piddle med
puddle, she ninnygoes nannygoes nancing by.  Yoh!  Brontolone slaaps,
yoh snoores.

Upon Benn Heather, in Seeple Isout too.  The cranic head on him,
caster of his reasons, peer yuthner in yondmist.  Whooth?  His clay
feet, swarded in verdigrass, stick up starck where he last fellonem,
by the mund of the magazine wall, where our maggy seen all, with her
sisterin shawl.  While over against this belles' alliance beyind Ill
Sixty, ollollowed ill!  bagsides of the fort, bom, tarabom, tarabom,
lurk the ombushes, the site of the lyffing-in-wait of the upjock and
hockums.
