== overview ==

* 'g' element groups elements. There's one character shaped like a
  cloud, whose belly contains a bunch of circles.  You might use a
  group to re-fill them all with a different color, or to scale or
  rotate them, maybe when the character gets excited.

== shapes ==

* circles/ellipses: represent an eye as an ellipse & eyeball as circle
  within ellipse; decreasing ellipse's rx causes blinking; adjusting
  circle's x makes you glance from side to side. How does the ellipse
  clip the circle when eye is closed? Extra credit: is the ellipse a
  path to which we can attach eyelashes?

== filters ==

* figure may have sunlight (light-source filter) shining on it,
  leaving a shadow (feOffset filter) behind it. The sun may animate
  across the top of the scene, animating how it shines on the figure &
  how the shadow falls.

* A figure might become blurred in the head when he gets tired.

== animations ==

* Figure appears to wander perpendicularly (upright) along a path;
  path is positioned w/3D perspective to make the figure move to
  foreground (larger) & background (smaller).
