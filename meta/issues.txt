* Edge Animate: why doesn't it include path/polygon tools?

* Edge Animate: why doesn't it incorporate HTML5 audio into the
  timeline UI?

* SVG: It's awkward that attributes do not animate via CSS, but can be
  animated via <animate> element.  Ideally you should be able to morph
  a path via CSS, the way you can for polygons defining a CSS
  exclusion. (caveat: # of points in each polygon must match)

* Edge animate: does its "keyframe" feature correspond 1-to-1 with
  CSS's, or does it also translate to SVG's SMILs?

* Test CSS transitions between two sets of SVG filters.

* SVG: it appears transform attribute is 2D-only, but that you can 3D
  transform an element via CSS.

* Custom filters: How does the 3D transform space defined in custom
  filters relate to the 3D necessary to define an overall scene?  I'd
  like to be able to use perspective & rotateX to place an arbitrary
  SVG path on the ground of a scene, so that an element gets bigger
  closer to the viewer.
