Represents content to flow among various block ''region''
elements. The '''NamedFlow''' interface allows access to both the
content of the flow and the series of regions in which it displays,
and helps determine if the content exceeds or falls short of the
number of regions necessary to display it.

Specifying an identifier for any element's
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] CSS property diverts its
content to a corresponding '''NamedFlow''' object. Other elements that
specify the same identifier as their
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] property serve as a chain
of ''regions'' that dynamically display the content.  (The
'''NamedFlow''' object is still available with NULL content if those
properties are later removed.)

Use the [[dom/apis/document/getNamedFlows|'''getNamedFlows''']] method
to gather named flows from a document.

[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/firstEmptyRegionIndex|'''firstEmptyRegionIndex''']]
Returns the index of the first empty element within a region chain

[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/overset|'''overset''']] Indicates whether a
flow's contents exceed available space within a region chain.

[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/name|'''name''']] Name of the flow,
corresponding to value specified by
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] or
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] CSS properties.
