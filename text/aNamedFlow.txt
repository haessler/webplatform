Represents content to flow among various block ''region'' elements.

A '''NamedFlow''' object is created when any element specifies the
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] CSS property, which
diverts its source content to the specified '''NamedFlow''', or the
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] property, which displays
it dynamically within a series of region elements.  (The null object
is still available if those properties are later removed.)

Use the [[dom/apis/document/getNamedFlows|'''getNamedFlows''']] method
to gather all named flows from a document.

Together, the [[css/cssom/NamedFlow/overset|'''overset''']] and
[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/firstEmptyRegionIndex|'''firstEmptyRegionIndex''']]
properties determine if the flow's source content corresponds to the
number of available regions that display it.

Use [[css/cssom/NamedFlow/getContent|'''getContent''']] to access the
source, 
[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/getRegions|'''getRegions''']] 
[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/getRegionsByContent|'''getRegionsByContent''']] 



[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/firstEmptyRegionIndex|'''firstEmptyRegionIndex''']]
Returns the index of the first empty element within a region chain

[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/overset|'''overset''']] Indicates whether a
flow's contents exceed available space within a region chain.

[[css/cssom/NamedFlow/name|'''name''']] Name of the flow,
corresponding to value specified by
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] or
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] CSS properties.


NAME

~== NamedFlow ==

~== 6.1. The NamedFlow interface ==

~Contains content used to flow text among various block region elements

~A named flow is created when it becomes referenced by the ‘flow-into’
~and/or ‘flow-from’ computed values. The following APIs allow scripts
~to reference a NamedFlow object representation of a named flow.

~The NamedFlow interface offers a representation of a named flow
~instance.

~The NamedFlow interface can be used for different purposes. For
~example, the getRegionsByContent() method can help navigate by
~bookmark: a script can find the regions that display a particular
~anchor and bring them to view.

~Likewise, the interface allows authors to check if all content has
~been fitted into existing regions. If it has, the overset attribute
~would be false.

~interface NamedFlow : EventTarget {
~  readonly attribute DOMString name;
~  readonly attribute boolean overset;
~  sequence<Region> getRegions();
~  readonly attribute integer firstEmptyRegionIndex;
~  NodeList getContent();
~  sequence<Region> getRegionsByContent(Node node);
~};

~~~

~The named flow states are :

~NULL: the named flow is not referenced by any ‘flow-into’ or
~‘flow-from’ computed value.

~CREATED: the named flow is referenced by at least one ‘flow-into’ or
~‘flow-from’ computed value.

~A NamedFlow object is live: it always represents the named flow with
~the corresponding name even if that named flow has transitioned to the
~NULL state.

~If a script holds a reference to a NamedFlow instance that has entered
~the NULL state, its attributes and methods should behave as follows:

~the name attribute returns its value as normal.

~the overset attribute returns false.

~the getRegions method returns an empty sequence.

~the firstEmptyRegionIndex attribute returns -1.

~the getContent() method returns an empty NodeList instance.

~the getRegionsByContent() method retuns an empty sequence.
