Returns a series of '''Range''' objects that represent the fragments of DOM content that currently flow into the region.

Regions may display more than one range, because more than one element may specify [[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] to contribute to a flow, and the boundary between those content elements may fall within a region. Also, any content element's nested elements can be diverted to a different named flow, thus interrupting the original sequence of content. (See [[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] for more details.)

By default, calling '''getRegionFlowRanges()''' on an overflowing region at the end of a chain (one whose [[apis/css-regions/Region/regionOverset|'''regionOverset''']] is '''overset''') returns fragments representing all remaining content that may [[css/properties/overflow|'''overflow''']] out of view.  If the region's [[css/properties/region-fragment|'''region-fragment''']] property is set to '''break''', it returns only those fragments of content that fit neatly within the region.

If the region is too small to display the content, it returns a single collapsed range.

Calling it on an empty region (one whose [[apis/css-regions/Region/regionOverset|'''regionOverset''']] is '''empty''') returns an empty list.

Calling it on an element that is no longer a region (when its [[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] property reverts to '''none''') returns '''null'''. The following tests whether the block element currently serves as a region:

 isRegion = (element.getRegionFlowRanges() !== null);
