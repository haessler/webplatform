~== Region_getRegionFlowRanges ==

~The getRegionFlowRanges method returns an array of Range instances
~corresponding to fragment from the named flow that is laid out in the
~region. If the region has not received a fragment because it is too
~small to accommodate any, the method returns a single Range where the
~startContainer and startOffset have the same values as the
~endContainer and endOffset and therefore the collapsed attribute on
~the Range is true. In that situation, if the region is the first in
~the region chain, the startContainer is the first Node in the named
~flow and the startOffset is zero. If the region is the last region in
~the region chain (but not the first and only one), the startContainer
~and startOffset are the same values as the endContainer and endOffset
~on the previous region in the region chain. The method returns null if
~the region object is not (or no longer) a region.
