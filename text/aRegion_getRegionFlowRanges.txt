~== Region_getRegionFlowRanges ==

~The getRegionFlowRanges method returns an array of Range instances
~corresponding to fragment from the named flow that is laid out in the
~region. If the region has not received a fragment because it is too
~small to accommodate any, the method returns a single Range where the
~startContainer and startOffset have the same values as the
~endContainer and endOffset and therefore the collapsed attribute on
~the Range is true. In that situation, if the region is the first in
~the region chain, the startContainer is the first Node in the named
~flow and the startOffset is zero. If the region is the last region in
~the region chain (but not the first and only one), the startContainer
~and startOffset are the same values as the endContainer and endOffset
~on the previous region in the region chain. The method returns null if
~the region object is not (or no longer) a region.

Returns a series of '''Range''' objects that represent the fragments
of DOM content that currently flow into the region.

Regions may display more than one range, because more than one element
may specify [[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] to contribute
to a flow, and the boundary between those content elements may fall
within a region. Also, any content element's nested elements can be
diverted to a different named flow, thus interrupting the original
sequence of content. (See [[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']]
for more details.)

By default, calling '''getRegionFlowRanges()''' on an overflowing
region at the end of a chain (one whose
[[apis/css-regions/Region/regionOverset|'''regionOverset''']] is
'''overset''') returns fragments representing all remaining content.
If the region's
[[css/properties/region-fragment|'''region-fragment''']] property is
set to '''break''', it returns only fragments of content that display.

If the region is too small to display the content, it returns a single
collapsed range

Calling it on an empty region (one whose
[[apis/css-regions/Region/regionOverset|'''regionOverset''']] is
'''empty''') returns an empty list.

Calling it on an element that is no longer a region (when its
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] property is set to
'''none''') returns '''null'''. The following tests whether the block
element currently serves as a region:

 isRegion = (element.getRegionFlowRanges() !== null);
