== document_getNamedFlows ==

An additional method on the Document interface provide access to named
flows.

 partial interface Document {
   NamedFlowCollection getNamedFlows();
 };

The getNamedFlows() method on the Document interface returns a static
snapshot of all the current named flows in the document.

The namedFlows collection must include all named flows that are
currently in the CREATED state. The list must not include named flows
that are in the NULL state.

NULL: the user agent must return null.

CREATED: the user agent must return a valid NamedFlow instance.

The NamedFlowCollection interface provides a list of current NamedFlow
instances in the document. The collection is a snapshot of the data.

interface NamedFlowCollection {
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  [IndexGetter] NamedFlow? item (unsigned long index);
  [NameGetter] NamedFlow? namedItem (DOMString name);
};

The length attribute returns the number of items in the collection.

The item(index) method returns the NamedFlow instance at index index
in the collection or undefined if index is out of range. An object
collection implementing NamedFlowCollection supports indices in the
range 0 â‰¤ index < collection.length.

The namedItem(name) method returns the NamedFlow instance in the
collection whose name attribute matches the supplied name, or
undefined if there is no match.
