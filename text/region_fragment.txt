In the following example, ''region_1'' can accommodate the gray text,
''region_2'' can accommodate the blue text, and the red ''overset''
text can't fit within the region chain:

Setting '''region-fragment''' to '''break''' suppresses display of the
overset text, as shown in the example at the bottom.  Setting
'''region-fragment''' to its default '''auto''' value makes overset
content display according to whatever
[[css/properties/overflow|'''overflow''']] property is defined, as
shown in the two examples on the right.

The property only applies to the final element in a ''region chain''
that is not large enough to accomodate remaining content. To behave
as a ''region'', the element's
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] must specify a named
flow, and display content from a corresponding
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']].
