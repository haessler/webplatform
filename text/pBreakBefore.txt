~== 3. Region flow break properties: ‘break-before’, ‘break-after’,
~‘break-inside’ ==

~User agents laying out content in multiple regions must determine
~where content breaks occur. The problem of breaking content into
~fragments fitting in regions is similar to breaking content into pages
~or columns.

~Each break ends layout in the current region and causes remaining
~pieces of content from the named flow to be visually formatted in the
~following region in the region chain, if there is one.

~The following extends the ‘break-before’, ‘break-after’ and
~‘break-inside’ properties from the [CSS3COL] specification to account
~for regions. The additional values are described below.

~Name: break-before

~Value: auto | always | avoid | left | right | page | column | region |
~avoid-page | avoid-column | avoid-region

~Initial: auto

~Applies to: block-level elements

~Inherited: no

~Percentages: N/A

~Media: visual

~Computed value: specified value

~...

~These properties describe page, column and region break behavior
~before/after/inside the generated box. These values are normatively
~defined in [CSS3COL]:

~This specification adds the following new values:

~region

~Always force a region break before (after) the generated box.

~avoid-region

~Avoid a region break before (after, inside) the generated box.

~The behavior of region breaks with regards to regions is identical to
~the behavior of page breaks with regards to pages, as defined in the
~[CSS21].
