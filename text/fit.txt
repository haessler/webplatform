A region's display state within a region chain:

* '''overset''' indicates the region is the last in the chain, and does not have enough room to display remaining content. See [[css/properties/region-fragment|region-fragment]] for display options.

* '''empty''' indicates content was accommodated by previous regions in the chain, or that no content flows into the chain.

* '''fit''' indicates various scenarios:

** when content appears within the last region in the chain but does not overflow it

** for regions that flow content into subsequent regions in the chain

** for regions that are too small to display the next available item of content, such as an image, which gets pushed into a subsequent region

** for elements that no longer behave as a region, which occurs when their [[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] property reverts to '''none'''
