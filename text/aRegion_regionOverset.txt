~== Region_regionOverset ==

~The regionOverset attribute returns one of the following values:

~‘overset’

~The region is the last one in the region chain and not able to fit the
~remaining content from the named flow. Note that the region's overflow
~property value can be used to control the visibility of the
~overflowing content and the ‘region-fragment’ property controls
~whether or not fragmentation happens on the content that overflows the
~last region.

~‘fit’

~The region's flow fragment content fits into the region's content
~box. If the region is the last one in the region chain, it means that
~the content fits without overflowing. If the region is not the last
~one in the region chain, that means the named flow content is further
~fitted in subsequent regions. In this last case, note that the named
~flow fragment may be empty (for example if the region is too small to
~accommodate any content). This value is returned if the region object
~is not (or no longer) a region.

~‘empty’

~All content from the named flow was fitted in prior regions.

~Note that if there is no content in the named flow, all regions
~associated with that named flow should have their regionOverset
~attribute return ‘empty’. If there is content in the flow but that
~content does not generate any box for visual formatting, the ‘overset’
~attribute on the first region in the region chain associated with the
~flow will return ‘fit’.
