~== NamedFlow_getContent ==

~The getContent() method returns an ordered collection of nodes that
~constitute the named flow. The returned list is a static snapshot of
~the named flow content at the time the method is invoked. This list
~contains the elements that were moved to the named flow by their
~flow-into property but not their descendants (unless the descendants
~are themselves moved to the named flow).
