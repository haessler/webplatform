~== 3.5. The @region rule ==

~An ‘@region’ rule contains style declarations specific to particular
~regions.

~ @region <selector> {
~     ... CSS styling rules ...
~ }

~The ‘@region’ rule consists of the keyword ‘@region’ followed by a
~selector and a block of style rules. The ‘@region’ rule and the
~selector constitute the region's ‘flow fragment’ selector. The
~region's flow fragment selector specifies which range of elements in
~the flow are subject to the style rules in the following block: it
~applies to the range (see [DOM]) from the region's flow that flows in
~the selected region(s).

~Model for styling element fragments

~Elements that are fully or partially in the ‘flow fragment’ may match
~any of the selectors found in the style rule. However, the style rules
~only apply to the portion of the element that falls into the
~corresponding region.

~Only a limited list of properties can be set in a region style rule:

~font properties

~color property

~opacity property

~background property

~‘word-spacing’

~‘letter-spacing’

~‘text-decoration’

~‘text-transform’

~‘line-height’

~alignment and justification properties

~border properties

~rounded corner properties

~border images properties

~margin properties

~padding properties

~‘text-shadow’ property

~‘box-shadow’ property

~‘box-decoration-break’ property

~‘width’ property

~In the following example, the named flow ‘article_flow’ flows through
~‘region_1’ and ‘region_2’.

~<style>
~    #div_1 {
~        flow-into: article_flow;
~    }

~    #region_1, #region_2 {
~        flow-from: article_flow;
~    }
~    /* region style "RSA" */
~    @region #region_1, #region_2 {
~        div {...}
~        p {...}
~    }

~    /* region style "RSB" */
~    @region #region_1 {
~        p {...}
~    }

~</style>

~<div id="div_1">
~    <p id="p_1">...</p>
~    <p id="p_2">...</p>

~</div>

~<div id="region_1"></div>

~<div id="region_2"></div>

~ div div_1
~ paragraph p_1
~ paragraph p_2
~ range of flow that fits into region_1
~ range of flow that fits into region_2

~The region style ‘RSA’ applies to flow content that is laid out in
~either ‘region_1’ or ‘region_2’.

~The first rule set ‘div {...}’ applies to all <div> elements that fit
~partially or fully into ‘region_1’ or ‘region_2’. div_1 is split
~between ‘region_1’ and ‘region_2’ and gets the style from this style
~rule.

~The second rule set ‘p {...}’ applies to all <p> elements that fit
~into ‘region_1’ or ‘region_2’. In our example, both p_1 and p_2 are
~selected.

~The region style ‘RSB’ applies to flow content that fits in
~‘region_1’.

~The first rule set ‘p {...}’ matches p_1 and p_2 because these
~paragraphs flow into ‘region_1’. Only the fragment of p_2 that flows
~into region_1 is styled with this rule.

~@region and specificity

~The specificity of the selectors in a ‘@region’ rule is calculated as
~defined in the CSS Selectors module (see [SELECT]). In other words,
~the ‘@region’ rule adds an extra condition to the selector's matching,
~but does not change the selector's specificity. This is the same
~behavior as selectors appearing in ‘@media’ rules declaration blocks
~(see [MEDIAQ]), where the rule does not influence the selectors'
~specificity.

~Consequently, selectors that match a given element (as describe
~above), participate in the CSS Cascading order as defined in [CSS21].

~Region styling does not apply to nested regions. For example, if a
~region ‘A’ receives content from a flow that contains region ‘B’, the
~content that flows into ‘B’ does not receive the region styling
~specified for region ‘A’.
