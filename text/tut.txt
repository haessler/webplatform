CSS Regions provides a way to implement complex magazine-style designs
in which content flows through freely positioned layout elements. The
feature offers you a way to flow content from one layout element to
another, but does not specify how those elements are positioned. For
that, use whatever technique is appropriate: floats, flexible boxes,
grid layout, or absolute positioning. The examples shown here use
flexible boxes.

==How flow-into and flow-from properties work==

* flow-into defines semantic content
* flow-from defines regions
* >1 named flow

==Controlling content flow==

* follows document order
* can be discontinuous
* DOM-inependent

==Diverting content from a flow==

* 1 content, >1 flow
* pull-quotes, sidebars, etc.

==Styling regions==

* the @region rule

==Breaking content into different regions==

* keep
* height: auto; ???

==Adaptive layouts with media queries==

* within @media rules

==More about content sources==

* chained content sources
* nested elements
* suppressing content

==Programming Flows and Regions==
