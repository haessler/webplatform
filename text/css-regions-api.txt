CSS Regions are defined by
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] and
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] CSS properties.  The
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']] property diverts content
into a ''named flow'', while the
[[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] property pours that
flow's content through a dynamic chain of ''region'' elements.  The
feature allows content to follow a path through arbitrarily placed
magazine-style layout elements.

Two interfaces provide programmatic access to the CSS Regions feature:

* The [[apis/css-regions/NamedFlow|'''NamedFlow''']] interface
provides access to the content defined as
[[css/properties/flow-into|'''flow-into''']], and the series of layout
regions defined as [[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']].  You
can check if the content exceeds or falls short of the available set
of regions, listen for changes to how the content flows through the
layout, and identify in which layout elements any content element
appears.

* The [[apis/css-regions/Region|'''Region''']] interface provides
information on each region within the chain: whether it displays any
content, how CSS styles the content based on the
[[css/atrules/@region|'''@region''']] rule, and how many fragmentary
ranges of content it presents.
