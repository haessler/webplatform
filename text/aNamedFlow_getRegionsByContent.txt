~== NamedFlow_getRegionsByContent ==

~The getRegionsByContent() method returns the sequence of regions that
~contain at least part of the target content node if it belongs to the
~named flow directly (i.e., its ‘flow-into’ computed value is the named
~flow) or one of its ancestors belongs to the named flow. Otherwise,
~the method returns an empty sequence. The returned value is a static
~sequence in document order.
