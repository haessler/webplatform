~== Region_getComputedRegionStyle ==

~The getComputedRegionStyle methods on the Region interface work the
~same as the getComputedStyle [CSSOM] methods on the Window interface
~[HTML5] with the following exceptions. For the Region interface the
~CSSStyleDeclaration returned must include the result of region
~styling. If the element is fragmented across region boundaries, the
~CSSStyleDeclaration returned must apply only to the fragment that
~flows through the CSS Region. The method returns null if the region
~object is not (or no longer) a region.

~If the element is not contained in the CSS Region at all, the method
~returns the region styling that would apply to the element if it were
~contained in the CSS Region (following how getComputedStyle works with
~elements not contained in the window's document).
