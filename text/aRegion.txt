The '''Region''' interface is available for any element that serves as a region whose [[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] CSS specifies it displays content from a ''named flow''.  Use the '''Region''' interface to determine whether any content flows through the region, what content currently displays, and any special CSS styling that applies.

The interface is still available for elements that change back to non-region elements, when their [[css/properties/flow-from|'''flow-from''']] property becomes '''none'''.



~== Region ==

~== 6.2. The Region interface ==

~The Region interface is a supplemental interface which must be
~implemented by all objects ( Elements, pseudo-elements or other CSS
~constructs such as slots) in an implementation which can be CSS
~Regions.

~interface Region {
~  readonly attribute DOMString regionOverset;
~  sequence<Range>? getRegionFlowRanges();
~  CSSStyleDeclaration getComputedRegionStyle(Element elt);
~  CSSStyleDeclaration getComputedRegionStyle(Element elt, DOMString
~  pseudoElt);
~};

~Element implements Region;

~~~~

~A Region instance may represent an object that is no longer a
~region. This may happen for example if the ‘flow-from’ property on the
~corresponding pseudo-element, element or other construct becomes
~‘none’ but a script is still holding a reference to the Region object.
