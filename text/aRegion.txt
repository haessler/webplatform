~== Region ==

~== 6.2. The Region interface ==

~The Region interface is a supplemental interface which must be
~implemented by all objects ( Elements, pseudo-elements or other CSS
~constructs such as slots) in an implementation which can be CSS
~Regions.

~[NoInterfaceObject]

~interface Region {
~  readonly attribute DOMString regionOverset;
~  sequence<Range>? getRegionFlowRanges();
~  CSSStyleDeclaration getComputedRegionStyle(Element elt);
~  CSSStyleDeclaration getComputedRegionStyle(Element elt, DOMString
~  pseudoElt);
~};

~Element implements Region;

~~~~

~A Region instance may represent an object that is no longer a
~region. This may happen for example if the ‘flow-from’ property on the
~corresponding pseudo-element, element or other construct becomes
~‘none’ but a script is still holding a reference to the Region object.
