==Transitions==

Transitions specify properties to animate, the animation's duration,
the function affecting the animation's progress, and an optional delay
before the animation starts.

The following example shows a series of transitions of a '''nav'''
element, from a collapsed icon state to an expanded panel:

[[Image:transitionUI.png]]

Each style sheet specifies a different '''max-width''' value, and the
transition allows the value to shift over the course of half a second:

<pre>
nav.expanded  { max-width : 95%; }
nav.collapsed { max-width : 10%; }
nav {
    transition    : max-width 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
</pre>

The transition shown above appears the same in both directions, but
specifying properties separately for each style sheet allows them to
be customized. In this variation, the panel takes twice as long to
expand than to collapse:

<pre>
nav.collapsed {
    max-width          : 10%;
    transition : max-width 0.5s ease-out;
}
nav.expanded {
    max-width          : 95%;
    transition : max-width 1s ease-in;
}
</pre>

The combined '''transition''' property combines individual
properties. (See [[Timing Functions]] below for more information on
the '''transition-timing-function''' property.)

<pre>
nav {
    transition-property        : max-width;
    transition-duration        : 0.5s;
    transition-timing-function : ease-in-out;
}
</pre>

When shifting from one interface state to another, transitions can
shift between more than one pair of style sheets. The example above
specifies an additional transition that fades and zooms in icons that
are nested within the navigation panel, providing the overall
appearance of a single animation effect:

<pre>
nav > .option {
    transition : all 0.5s linear;
}
nav.expanded > .option {
    opacity            : 1;
    transform  : scale(1.0);
}
nav.collapsed > .option {
    opacity            : 0;
    transform  : scale(0.0);
}
</pre>

The fade is specified using '''opacity''', and the zoom effect with
'''transform''', discussed in the [[next section]].
A transition property of '''all''' applies to any valid property that
differs between the two states.

Transitions apply not only to predefined style sheets, but more
flexibly to values that are assigned dynamically, which helps to
smooth shifts between application states. The example above would also
display a transition if the '''max-width''' value were assigned directly
to the element:

<pre>
icon.style.maxWidth = '95%';
</pre>

'''Note:''' CSS transitions perform robustly in response to ambiguous
user input.  As the navigation panel expands in the example above,
tapping elsewhere gracefully interrupts and reverses the transition to
its collapsed icon state.

==What Can Be Transitioned?==

Most any CSS property expressed as a simple numeric measurement or
color value can be transitioned between two style sheets. Color names
correspond internally to numeric values, so they can be transitioned,
along with keywords such as '''thin''' and '''thick''' that apply to
'''border-width'''.

Transitions don't affect named values that refer to discrete states,
such as the '''left''' and '''right''' properties used by
'''text-align'''.  Property values that feature complex syntax, such
as for [[gradients]], [[masks]], and [[reflections]], also cannot be
transitioned.

In the example above, the '''max-width''' property in each style sheet
specifies measurements as percentage units. Transitions may not work
properly between fixed and flexible units.

Transitions cannot be applied to dynamically inserted content via
''':before''' and ''':after''' dynamic class selectors.

Transitions also cannot be applied to dynamically positioned elements.
The following example shows a list of stacked items that rearrange
themselves when they are dismissed or filtered away:

[[Image:scr_anim_skew.png]]

Items must be assigned to a grid, and can't be animated by letting the
browser stack them freely.  However, implicit CSS values may be
transitoned. For example, a transition to a specific
'''background-color''' from a set of style sheets that don't specify any
color assume the default value of '''transparent'''.

==Transition sequences==

As [[shown above]], separate transitions can be applied
simultaneously to different sets of elements.  Alternately, more than
one transition can be applied to the same set of elements.

Each transition property can accommodate more than one value, each
separated with a comma. Applying an accompanying delay allows for
transitions to appear in sequence. The following example shows how a
panel may expand in two half-second stages that modify the '''width'''
followed by the '''height''', then reverse the sequence when collapsing:

<pre>
nav.expanded {
  transition-property : width, height;
}
nav.collapsed {
  transition-property : height, width;
}
nav {
  transition-duration : 0.5s, 0.5s;
  transition-delay    : 0.0s, 0.5s;
}
</pre>

The following example uses these sequential transitions to slide out
an embedded a navigation panel:

[[Image:scr_anim_trans_accord1.png]]
[[Image:scr_anim_trans_accord2.png]]
[[Image:scr_anim_trans_accord3.png]]

The following example shows a photo gallery interface that uses the
same technique to flip images to reveal descriptive text. It relies on
a sequence of simple [[2D '''scale''' transforms]], one that
narrows the first visible element, followed by another that widens the
second hidden one:

[[Image:scr_anim_gallery.png]]
[[Image:scr_anim_gallery2.png]]

This example shows how flexibly transitions may be applied.  When
users tap on adjacent photos, the panel automatically flips back to
its original state as it is moved to the side.

==Timing functions==

Timing properties allow the speed at which transitions (and
[[keyframe animations]]) progress to vary over
their duration.

If a timing function's value specifies the '''linear''' keyword, the
transition starts and stops abruptly, and its speed remains
constant. Otherwise, timing functions specify progress in terms of a
bezier curve whose control points are expressed as decimals. Various
keyword values correspond to bezier functions as follows:

* '''linear''':  '''cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)'''

* '''ease''' (default):  '''cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0)'''

* '''ease-in''':  '''cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1.0, 1.0)'''

* '''ease-out''':  '''cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1.0)'''

* '''ease-in-out''':  '''cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1.0)'''

The following example demonstrates various preset timing functions and
custom '''cubic-bezier()''' functions:

[[Image:scr_anim_timer.png]]

See [[netzgesta.de]] for an interactive visualization of how preset and
'''cubic-bezier()''' timing functions appear as a response curve.





==Transitions==

This example expands a navigation panel from a small icon:

[[Image:animate.png]]
[[Image:animate2.png]]

Tapping on the element toggles its '''expanded''' class, which alters
its '''width''', '''border''', and '''background-position'''
properties. The '''transition''' property animates specified
properties, '''all''' in this case, over the course of one second:

<pre>
#navbar {
    transition: all 1s;
    border: solid #fff 2px;;
    background-image: url(../img/i0.png);
    background-position: 90% 50%;
    width: 36px;
}

#navbar.expanded {
    border: solid #aaa 2px;
    width: 280px;
    background-position: 200% 50%;
}
</pre>

Icons within the navigation panel also animate. The '''opacity'''
property fades them in, and the '''scale''' transform zooms them in:

<pre>
#navbar > a {
    transition: all 1s;
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0);
}

#navbar.expanded > a {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
}
</pre>

Tapping on any of the icons causes another panel to slide in, first
horizontally, then vertically. This sequence relies on a two-state
transition that manipulates the element's '''height''' and
'''translate()''' transform function independently:

<pre>
#panel {
    transition: height 0.5s 0.0s, transform 0.5s 0.5s;
    transform: translateX(-120%);
    height: 10%;
}

#panel:target {
    transition: transform 0.5s 0.0s, height 0.5s 0.5s;
    transform: translateX(0%);
    height: 100%;
}
</pre>

Both animations within the sequence last half a second, and the second
is delayed by the same amount.

==Transition Events==

Applying a '''webkittransitionend''' event handler allows you to
execute subsequent transitions conditionally, or to perform any other
action after a transition finishes executing. This example resembles
the previous sequence, but implements transitions separately with
'''higher''' and '''wider''' CSS classes:

<pre>
div {
    background: #000;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    transition: all 0.5s;
}
.wider { width: 200px; }
.higher { height: 200px; }
</pre>

After the initial transition executes, this example prompts users if
they want to continue:

<pre>
document.querySelector('div').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    if (e.target.classList.length == 0) {
        e.target.classList.add('wider');
        e.target.dataset.direction = 'expand';
    }
    else if (e.target.classList.length == 2) {
        e.target.classList.remove('higher');
        e.target.dataset.direction = 'collapse';
    }
    else {
         confirm('OK to expand?')
             ? e.target.classList.add('higher')
             : e.target.classList.remove('wider');
    }
});

document.querySelector('div').addEventListener(
  'webkitTransitionEnd', function(e) {
    if (e.target.classList.length == 1) {
        e.target.dataset.direction == 'expand'
            && confirm('expand further?')
            && e.target.classList.add('higher');
        e.target.dataset.direction == 'collapse'
            && confirm('collapse further?')
            && e.target.classList.remove('wider');
        e.target.dataset.direction = '';

    }
    console.log( e.propertyName + ", " + e.elapsedTime + 's' );
});
</pre>

The event's '''propertyName''' corresponds to the value of each
'''transition-property''' that completes its transition.  The
'''elapsedTime''' correponds to each '''transition-duration'''.



==CSS Keyframe Animations==

CSS ''transitions'' apply to shifts between distinct interface states.
CSS ''keyframe animations'' allow for more complex effects, and can be
applied more freely, for example to execute animations continuously.
This example inserts a series of scrolling banner ads into the
interface:

[[Image:keyframe1.png]]
[[Image:keyframe2.png]]

After an initial 4-second delay, an animation titled ''push_down'' is
applied to the main panel, which takes 1 second to execute:

<pre>
article {
    animation: push_down 1s 4s;
    animation-fill-mode: both;
}
</pre>

The animation is defined elsewhere within the CSS region, within a
'''@keyframes''' rule. Each keyframe manipulates CSS properties
over the course of the animation:

<pre>
@keyframes push_down {
    from { margin-top: 0em }
    to   { margin-top: 4em }
}
</pre>

The '''animation-fill-mode''' property avoids abrupt transitions
before and after keyframes execute. It specifies that the keyframe's
initial value for each manipulated property overrides the element's
default property, so that the animation's initial appearance precedes
any delay. The final state of each property also persists after the
animation finishes executing.

The scrolling banner specifies a series of two animations. The first
(''slide_down'') executes once, after the same 4-second delay, with
its properties filling '''backward''' so that they persist after the
animation stops:

<pre>
header {
    animation-name		: slide_down	, scroll;
    animation-duration		: 1s		, 20s;
    animation-delay		: 4s		, 5s;
    animation-iteration-count	: 1		, infinite;
    animation-fill-mode		: backward      , both;
    animation-play-state        : running;
}
</pre>

The corresponding keyframe drops the element from above the top of the
screen:

<pre>
@keyframes slide_down {
    from { transform: translateY(-10em) }
    to { transform: translateY(0) }
}
</pre>

The second ''scroll'' keyframe executes over the course of 20 seconds,
delayed after the initial set of animations execute, with the
'''infinite''' iteration count setting it to run continuously.
Intermediary keyframe states are represented as percentages:

<pre>
@keyframes scroll {
    0%   { transform: translateX(0) }
    17%  { transform: translateX(0%) }
    20%  { transform: translateX(-20%) }
    37%  { transform: translateX(-20%) }
    40%  { transform: translateX(-40%) }
    57%  { transform: translateX(-40%) }
    60%  { transform: translateX(-60%) }
    77%  { transform: translateX(-60%) }
    80%  { transform: translateX(-80%) }
    97%  { transform: translateX(-80%) }
    100% { transform: translateX(0%) }
}
</pre>

The scrolling element has a '''column-count''' of '''5''' and a '''width'''
of '''500%''', so the translations are measured relative to that wide
element.

Animations can be paused as they progress. Tapping the scrolling bar
in this example toggles a ''pause'' class. When applied, it pauses
the ''scroll'' animaton and triggers a secondary ''pulse'' keyframe
that makes inner banner elements fade in and out:

<pre>
.pause {
    animation-play-state: paused;
}
.pause > div {
    animation		: pulse 0.5s infinite;
    animation-direction : alternate;
}
@keyframes pulse {
    from { opacity: 1 }
    to { opacity: 0.5 }
}
</pre>

Note the keyframe's start and end state differ, but its ''direction''
is set to '''alternate''' forwards and backwards on successive odd/even
iterations.

==XXX G==

This section provides guidance on how CSS-based animations can be
incorporated into vibrant mobile interfaces. It discusses two related
CSS features.  ''Transitions'' animate between two sets of style
sheets.  ''Keyframe animations'' enable free-form animation sequences.
(Many of the examples in this section also demonstrate ''transforms'',
potentially complex but otherwise static visual effects discussed in
[[the following section]].)

'''Note:''' Animations can also be implemented with Canvas or SVG graphics
libraries, but CSS animations are most useful when designing an
overall interface.  CSS-based animation also offers a tangible
performance boost over animations implemented with JavaScript timers.

==Keyframe Animations==

Keyframe animations offer an easy way to specify sequences involving
many animated transitions. Unlike [[transitions]], they
can execute freely, and are not assigned to shifts between sets of
style sheets.

The following example shows a simple animation of icons that pulse
three times when tapped:

[[Image:scr_anim_pulse.png]]

It uses the following CSS, shown here in both abbreviated and long
form:

<pre>
nav > a:target { animation : pulse 0.5s 3; }

nav > a:target {
    animation-name            : pulse;
    animation-duration        : 0.5s;
    animation-iteration-count : 3;
}
</pre>

As with transitions, the '''duration''' specifies the length of the
entire animation, in this case half a second.  By default, animations
execute once, but setting an integer '''iteration-count''' allows them
to repeat. The '''infinite''' keyword runs the animation continuously.
The animation must have a '''name''', with a corresponding ''keyframes''
rule detailing the animation's full progression, specified elsewhere
within the CSS:

<pre>
@keyframes pulse {
    0% { opacity   : 1.0 }
    50% { opacity  : 0.5 }
    100% { opacity : 1.0 }
}
</pre>

This animation shifts between two different '''opacity''' values over
the course of a half second, with percentages marking intermediary
states within the course of the animation.  Like regular CSS
selectors, each intermediary state can specify various CSS properties.

The following shows a different way to implement this simple
animation:

<pre>
@keyframes pulse {
    from { opacity : 1.0 }
    to   { opacity : 0.5 }
}

nav > a:target {
    animation : pulse 0.25s 0.5s 6 alternate linear;
}

nav > a:target {
    animation-name            : pulse;
    animation-duration        : 0.25s;
    animation-iteration-count : 6;
    animation-direction       : alternate;
    animation-delay           : 0.5s;
    animation-timing-function : linear;
}
</pre>

In this case, the keyframe animation only defines half of the entire
visual sequence.  Instead, the animation's '''direction''' is
alternated, so that even-numbered iterations are played back in
reverse. (To match the original appearance, the iteration count is
doubled, and the duration is halved.)

This modified animation adds a half-second '''delay''', in this case to
allow enough time for the user's finger to lift from the mobile screen
to see the entire animation execute. It also specifies a linear
[['''timing-function''']] apply to shifts within the
animation.

The following example shows a more complex sequence of alternating
rapid shifts and longer static phases, in which five banner options
scroll continuously at the top of the screen.  (It uses [[translations]] to manipulate a [[multicolumn
element]] that is five times the width of the window.)

[[Image:scr_css3_multicol.png]]

<pre>
@keyframes banner_scroll {
    0%   { transform : translate(0%);   }
    18%  { transform : translate(0%);   }
    20%  { transform : translate(-20%); }
    38%  { transform : translate(-20%); }
    40%  { transform : translate(-40%); }
    58%  { transform : translate(-40%); }
    60%  { transform : translate(-60%); }
    78%  { transform : translate(-60%); }
    80%  { transform : translate(-80%); }
    95%  { transform : translate(-80%); }
    100% { transform : translate(0%);   }
}
</pre>

The example above executes continuously when the page loads.  The
sliding-navigation example below executes once when the page loads,
but contextually based on the target of navigation within the page:

[[Image:scr_anim_slide1.png]]

<pre>
<style>
#in:target           { animation : from_right 0.25s  }
#out:target + .panel { animation : from_left 0.25s }

@keyframes from_right {
    from { transform : translate(80%); }
    to   { transform : translate(0%); }
}
@keyframes from_left {
    from { transform : translate(-80%); }
    to { transform   : translate(0%); }
}
</style>

...

<a id='out'></a>
<div id='in' class='panel'>
...
</div>
</pre>

The following slide-show example assigns the same animation to many
elements, sliding them in and out of view.  It specifies progressively
longer delays to each element to build a larger sequence, with one
element's duration extended to provide more time to read it:

[[Image:scr_anim_present.png]]

<pre>
section {
    animation-name     : slideFrame;
    animation-duration : 5s;
    transform          : translate(-150%);
    transform-origin   : bottom;
}
section:nth-of-type(1) { animation-delay  : 2s; }
section:nth-of-type(2) { animation-delay  : 8s; }
section:nth-of-type(3) { animation-delay  : 14s; }
section:nth-of-type(4) {
    animation-delay    : 20s;
    animation-duration : 8s;
}
section:nth-of-type(5) { animation-delay  : 29s; }
</pre>

The animation provides the illusion that the incoming slide hits a
hard barrier, while outgoing slides speed up gradually. This can be
accomplished by changing the timing function during the course of the
animation:

<pre>
@keyframes slideFrame {
  from {
    animation-timing-function : linear;
    transform: translate(-150%) skewX(5deg);
  }
  10% { transform : translate(0) skewX(5deg); }
  15% {
    animation-timing-function : default;
    transform : translate(0) skewX(-5deg);
  }
  20% { transform : translate(0) skewX(0deg); }
  90% { transform : translate(0) skewX(0deg); }
  to { transform : translate(150%) skewX(10deg); }
}
</pre>

As is true for transitions, an element may be assigned more than one
keyframe animation:

<pre>
.pair_keyframes { animation : anim1 1s 2 alternate, anim2 2s; }
</pre>

Even if one of the animations is delayed, each keyframe rule must
manipulate different sets of CSS properties, or it does not work.
Animations may also execute along with transitions, as in the
following example.

[[Image:scr_anim_combine.png]]

<pre>
@keyframes nod {
    from {
        box-shadow    : transparent 0 0 0 0;
        background-position   : 50% 50%;
    }
    20% { background-position : 50% 90% }
    40% { background-position : 50% 10% }
    60% { background-position : 50% 90% }
    80% { background-position : 50% 10% }
    to {
        background-position   : 50% 50%;
        box-shadow    : lightgreen 0em 0em 0.5em 0.25em;
    }
}
</pre>

The accompanying CSS shows how the two separate visual effects might
be consolidated within a single keyframe rule, with the '''start''' and
'''end''' value of the '''box-shadow''' property matching the
initial and destination style sheet, to simulate a transition.

==Dynamic Keyframes==

Keyframe animations can be initiated by changing the
'''animation-name''' to one with a matching keyframe rule.  This can be
done by applying a style sheet, or by manipulating elements directly:

<pre>
element.style.WebkitAnimationName = 'roll';
</pre>

Dynamically generated keyframe rules only activate when added to a
local '''style''' region within the page. They can be redefined
immediately after they execute, as the animation proceeds.

The following example shows a gaming dice piece built with [[3D transforms]]. An additional keyframe animation spins
the entire cube using an additional set of randomly generated 3D
transforms.  Tapping the element applies the ''roll'' class, which
changes the animation name from a default empty string to one that
matches a keyframe rule:

[[Image:scr_anim_dice.png]]

<pre>
.dice {
    animation-name            : "";
    animation-duration        : 1s;
    animation-iteration-count : 2;
    animation-direction       : alternate;
    animation-timing-function : linear;
}
.roll {
    animation-name            : haphazard_spin;
}
@keyframes haphazard_spin {
  from { transform: rotateX(20deg)  rotateY(40deg)  rotateZ(30deg)  }
  25%  { transform: rotateX(190deg) rotateY(220deg) rotateZ(300deg) }
  50%  { transform: rotateX(220deg) rotateY(160deg) rotateZ(80deg)  }
  75%  { transform: rotateX(20deg)  rotateY(40deg)  rotateZ(230deg) }
  to   { transform: rotateX(184deg) rotateY(300deg) rotateZ(150deg) }
}
</pre>

Applications may halt animations in progress by setting
'''animation-play-state''' to '''paused''' or back to '''running''':

<pre>
element.style.WebkitAnimationPlayState = 'paused';
element.style.WebkitAnimationPlayState = 'running';
</pre>

If there is a difference between an element's conventional set of CSS
properties, and CSS properties as they are defined at the start and
end of a keyframe rule, they may become conspicuous if the animation
is delayed, or if it executes a finite number of times.  Setting
'''animation-fill-mode''' to '''forwards''', '''backwards''', or
'''both''' determines whether the set of CSS properties that bounds the
keyframe sequence appears outside the duration of its execution,
potentially overriding properties ''not'' defined in keyframes.

The following example allows users to initiate a marquee-style scroll.
Tapping on the [[ellipses]] that mark overly long song
titles generates a custom keyframe based on the '''scrollWidth''' of the
overflowing element, so that longer song titles scroll more quickly
than short ones.  The keyframe manipulates the '''text-indent'''
property to scroll the element off to the left, hide the text while it
is repositioned off to the right midway through the animation, then
scroll it back into view:

[[Image:scr_anim_marquee.png]]

<pre>
@keyframes custom {
    0%   { text-indent: 0%    ; color: #000        }
    49%  { text-indent: -125% ; color: #000        }
    50%  { text-indent: -125% ; color: transparent }
    51%  { text-indent: 125%  ; color: transparent }
    52%  { text-indent: 125%  ; color: #000        }
    100% { text-indent: 0%    ; color: #000        }
}
</pre>

'''Note:''' In the animation above, the '''text-indent''' property is defined
redundantly within the 49% and 50% keyframes. It accounts for a slight
variation in how browsers interpret keyframes.  Removing the
'''text-indent''' property from the 49% keyframe may lead some browsers
to assume the property should transition smoothly between the 0% and
50% keyframes. Others may assume the 49% keyframe should be filled
with the property's last known value, zero, which in this case would
lead to a long static period followed by an unintentionally abrupt
transition.


=Animations=

Animations can help engage users with your application and provide
rich visual context for its various functions.

Web interfaces are driven by CSS ''style sheets''. Web applications
can dynamically apply different sets of style sheets, and CSS
''transitions'' can make those interface shifts animate gradually.
CSS ''keyframe animations'' offer more flexibility, and are not tied
to shifts between style CSS.
